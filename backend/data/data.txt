- The transcript discusses ways to increase dopamine for improving working memory.

- Binaural beats, which involve listening to sounds of different frequencies in each ear, have been shown to improve working memory performance.

- Studies have found small to moderate improvements in working memory tasks with the use of 40 hertz and 15 hertz binaural beats.

- The studies did not establish a direct relationship between binaural beats and dopamine levels.

- Binaural beats can be used during or before working memory tasks and are a non-pharmacologic, zero-cost approach to improving working memory.

- There are over-the-counter compounds that can increase dopamine levels and potentially improve working memory.

- L-tyrosine and mucuna prurines are two supplements that can increase dopamine levels.

- L-tyrosine has been shown to improve working memory in studies, but the dosages used in the studies were very high.

- It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before adding or removing any supplements from your regimen.

- If considering supplementing with L-tyrosine or mucuna prurines, start with a low dose to determine the minimal effective dose for you.

- Mucunipurines is similar to the prescription drug L-DOPA and can improve working memory.

- Bromocriptine, a dopamine agonist, has been shown to increase dopamine and improve working memory in individuals with low baseline levels of dopamine.

- Traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative conditions, and ADHD involve deficits in working memory and attention.

- Drugs that increase dopamine and norepinephrine, such as Adderall and Ritalin, are commonly used to treat ADHD.

- There are various approaches to improving working memory, including behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplement-based tools, and prescription drugs.

- The conversation is about procrastination and its relationship with creativity.

- The speaker identifies as a pre-crastinator, someone who feels the pressure and focus of a deadline from the start of a project.

- Procrastination is not about laziness but about avoiding negative emotions like boredom, fear, anxiety, or confusion.

- The other speaker sees procrastination as a strategy to simulate the excitement and pressure of deadlines.

- Both speakers find joy in the preparation and research process before presenting or completing a task.

- They found that people who procrastinate moderately tend to generate the most creative ideas.

- Pre-procrastinators and chronic procrastinators both experience tunnel vision, limiting their ability to come up with novel ideas.

- Moderate procrastinators have enough time to work on ideas in the back of their minds, leading to more creative outcomes.

- In order for procrastination to fuel creativity, individuals must be intrinsically motivated by the task they are procrastinating on.

 The speaker discusses their experience of using self-deception to develop interest in topics they initially had minimal interest in.

- They mention how they used this technique to learn vocabulary words for the GRE.

- The speaker raises questions about true intrinsic motivation and its connection to performance.

- They mention a study on rewarding kids for tasks they were already intrinsically motivated to do.

- The speaker suggests methods to nurture intrinsic motivation, such as designing tasks, reward systems, and self-persuasion.

- When faced with a task that is not intrinsically motivating, it can be helpful to find a sense of purpose or a meaningful outcome.

- Research shows that having a purpose for learning can increase persistence and lead to better grades.

- Intrinsic motivation is driven by curiosity about the "how," while a sense of purpose comes from thinking about the "why."

- Connecting a task to something else that you care about can help increase motivation.

- Motivating oneself can be more challenging than motivating someone else, but using techniques like motivational interviewing can be effective.

- Quality nutrition is important for physical and mental health, cognitive functioning, memory, learning, and focus.

- Getting enough vitamins, minerals, probiotics, prebiotics, and fiber from high-quality sources is crucial for cellular functions and gut microbiome.

- It can be challenging to consume enough servings of fruits, vegetables, fiber, and probiotics daily.

- AG1 is a product that provides foundational nutritional needs and is endorsed by the speaker.

- There is a special offer available for AG1 on drinkag1.com/huberman.

- Extrinsic rewards can be valuable for motivating both kids and adults.

- Extrinsic rewards are better for motivating quantity rather than quality.

- Extrinsic rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation.

- Autonomy and choice can mitigate the negative effects of extrinsic rewards.

- Extrinsic rewards can be effective in getting kids to try new things, but the hope is that they will develop intrinsic motivation over time.

- The speaker discusses the struggle between wanting to enjoy the world and wanting to improve it, which makes it difficult to plan their day.

- Social media and smartphones have made it harder to concentrate and enjoy tasks, as people constantly interrupt themselves.

- Blocking out uninterrupted time is important for productivity, as shown by an experiment where engineers had no interruptions before noon and had increased productivity.

- The speaker suggests protecting the first few hours and last few hours of the day for deep work, and doing meetings and off-task activities in the middle.

- The speaker and the host discuss the optimal times for analytical and creative thinking, as well as the post-lunch dip in autonomic arousal that may lead to more focused meetings.

- The speaker believes that creative work and brainstorming are best done in the late afternoon.

- Holding university lectures in the evening resulted in students being more relaxed and less socially anxious.

- There is evidence that early birds tend to be more creative in the morning due to increased energy levels and divergent thinking.

- Different creative processes involve either stillness of the body and active thinking or active movement and free association of thoughts.

- The speaker is interested in studying the brain states and resting network activation during stillness and deliberate thinking.

- The speaker discusses the challenge of gauging the quality of ideas and avoiding false negatives.

- They describe their process of filtering ideas by sending a draft to trusted individuals for feedback and using their scores as a calibration mechanism.

- The speaker emphasizes the importance of seeking feedback from multiple sources and not getting defensive or threatened by criticism.

- They share a personal experience where negative feedback led to success and highlight the importance of focusing on task-oriented feedback rather than personal opinions.

- The speaker suggests asking for advice for the future rather than feedback to receive more constructive input.

- The speaker discusses the concept of the "second score" as a way to improve at taking constructive criticism.

- They share a personal story about receiving harsh feedback and how they adjusted their approach to be more open to criticism.

- The idea of focusing on verbs rather than nouns is emphasized, suggesting that taking action and learning from feedback is more important than dwelling on past mistakes.

- The importance of growth mindset and continuous improvement is highlighted, emphasizing that it is a daily practice.

- The speaker acknowledges that developing the ability to learn from feedback is an ongoing process and cannot be achieved through a single event or workshop.

- Growth mindset, when combined with the understanding that stress and anxiety can enhance performance, becomes more visible in mindsets and performance.

- Growth mindset is particularly important for marginalized and impoverished communities who may have never heard the message that they are capable of evolving their skills.

- The context and environment in which growth mindset is taught is crucial for its effectiveness, such as a classroom culture that believes in the capability of students to learn and grow.

- Scaffolding, providing temporary support to help individuals improve at something, is often missing when trying to implement growth mindset.

- In addition to mindset, it is important to think about how to put beliefs into practice by creating a context that allows individuals to do so.

- The conversation is about the relationship between intrinsic motivation and performance on other tasks.

- People with ADHD are good at paying attention to things they enjoy, but struggle with less interesting tasks.

- The study discussed explores the dark side of intrinsic motivation and how being passionate about one task can negatively impact performance on less interesting tasks.

- The researcher suggests that task sequencing can help mitigate the negative effects, such as starting with a moderately interesting task before moving on to more exciting ones.

- The conversation also touches on the idea that mundane experiences can help keep expectations grounded and allow for pleasant surprises.

- The speaker discusses the concept of momentum and how positive experiences can carry over into other tasks.

- They mention that extreme intrinsic motivation can have a performance cost on other tasks.

- The speaker suggests that small wins in one area of life can boost confidence and efficacy in other areas.

- They discuss strategies for segmenting negative experiences, such as distraction and reframing.

- The speaker reflects on the impact of smartphones and constant communication on our positive psychology.

- The speaker sets boundaries around phone use, including not scrolling on social media and not picking up the phone past 9 p.m.

- The speaker keeps a to-do and to-don't list on a Word document on their computer.

- The speaker prefers to take notes on paper rather than on their phone.

- Taking notes by hand is shown to improve memory compared to typing.

- The unconscious mind is described as the real supercomputer of the brain, driving both conscious and unconscious behaviors.

- Blind spots are often associated with biases and heuristics in our thinking.

- The "I'm not biased bias" is a dangerous meta bias where people believe they are more objective than others and are incapable of recognizing their own biases.

- People with high cognitive ability are more likely to fall victim to the bias blind spot.

- The reflected best self exercise helps individuals recognize their strengths by collecting stories from people who know them well.

- The exercise allows individuals to gain clarity on their strengths and identify common themes in situations where they excel.

- The speaker reflects on their early academic career and how it relates to their current work.

- They mention being interested in synthesizing ideas and sharing knowledge rather than having original insights.

- The speaker's students encouraged them to share their research outside of the classroom.

- They discuss the importance of review articles and the ability to synthesize information.

- The speaker praises the person they are speaking to for helping people identify and overcome their blind spots through social media content.

- The speaker discusses three mental modes of thinking: preachers, prosecutors, and politicians.

- These modes can be adaptive in certain roles, but they prevent questioning of one's own assumptions and beliefs.

- The speaker identifies their biggest vice as prosecutor mode, where they feel the need to correct others when they believe they are wrong.

- The speaker suggests thinking like a scientist as an alternative, with humility and curiosity to seek out new knowledge.

- The speaker emphasizes the importance of questioning and challenging assumptions, and basing views on good data rather than blind faith.

- Teaching people to be scientists involves understanding the concept of a hypothesis and actively trying to disprove it.

- Confirmation bias leads people to seek out information that supports their preexisting beliefs.

- The desire for affiliation and fear of social exclusion contribute to the creation of echo chambers and filter bubbles.

- Recognizing blind spots is difficult on one's own, so input from others is important.

- Following people who have different conclusions but demonstrate integrity in their thought process can expand one's thinking.

- The conversation is about the balance between authenticity and etiquette in communication.

- Authenticity without boundaries is careless, and authenticity without empathy is selfish.

- It is important to consider if our actions and words align with our principles and values.

- Sincerity is about bringing the outside in and becoming the person we claim to be.

- It is crucial to be thoughtful and consider the potential impact of our posts and communication.

- The speaker discusses the concept of potential and how people often underestimate their own potential.

- They mention that motivation and opportunity are more important than raw talent for growth.

- The speaker shares a personal example of how they lacked many abilities required for diving but were able to excel through hard work and setting specific goals.

- They emphasize that overcoming obstacles and making progress is more motivating than simply performing well.

- The speaker criticizes the idea of playing to one's strengths, arguing that it can prevent individuals from developing skills that require effort and ultimately bring greater satisfaction.

- The speaker identifies three skills that help people realize their potential: embracing discomfort, being a sponge for new information, and being an imperfectionist.

- Perfectionism can lead to burnout, depression, and anxiety, and does not necessarily lead to better performance at work.

- The speaker suggests that setting standards of excellence rather than perfection can be more beneficial.

- The speaker aims for a nine in important tasks and is okay with a lower standard for less significant tasks.

- The speaker warns against getting caught up in perfectionism on trivial matters.

- Early success can be a motivator and build momentum, but it can also lead to complacency and competency traps.

- Achieving goals can make people rest on their laurels and not adapt to a changing world.

- It is important to embrace failure and take risks in order to challenge oneself and grow.

- Setting a goal to start at least one project every year that doesn't succeed can lead to growth and potential.

- Succeeding on 90% of projects should be considered a successful year, aiming for 100% success is aiming too low.

- The speaker is considering starting a podcast where people debate controversial topics and can tag in others to challenge arguments.

- One potential controversial topic they mention is policies for trans athletes in sports.

- They also discuss the idea of bringing together people interested in pragmatic policy solutions to rewrite the Constitution.

- The speaker is considering writing a sci-fi novel but is unsure if it would be a good use of their time.

- The person they are speaking with encourages them to pursue these projects and believes they would be successful.

- Nobel Prize winning scientists are more likely to have artistic hobbies, such as playing musical instruments, drawing/painting, and writing poetry/fiction.

- The speaker, a former magician, is intrigued by the risk, thrill, and memory manipulation involved in magic.

- Magic informs the speaker's work in science communication, as misdirection and surprise are important in both disciplines.

- The speaker's goal is to challenge conventional wisdom and question assumptions in a way that surprises and interests people, rather than making them feel tricked or manipulated.

- The speaker compares the illusion of magic to the suspension of reality in professional wrestling, where fans enjoy wondering if some aspects are not planned.

- Science communication aims for four things: interesting, clear, actionable, and surprising.

- Rigor is the foundation of science communication, with data to support it.

- Murray Davis argues that ideas live because they are interesting, and surprise is a major driver of interest.

- Self-reflection and understanding oneself and others are also important factors of interest.

- Learning something that helps make sense of a puzzling experience or enriches one's worldview can be intriguing and useful.

- Affect labeling is an effective emotion regulation strategy.

- The term "languishing" resonated with people as it described a feeling of stagnation and emptiness.

- Understanding the neurological basis of thoughts, feelings, and actions can help people believe in them more.

- Languishing may be a common experience and could have evolutionary benefits.

- Languishing can lead to moments of change and growth.

- The speaker discusses the importance of making children feel that they matter and can contribute.

- They share a personal story about seeking advice from their daughter and how it boosted her confidence.

- The speaker suggests that parents should seek their child's guidance on challenges they are facing to boost their confidence and problem-solving skills.

- The concept of the "coach effect" is mentioned, where giving advice instead of receiving it can increase motivation and confidence.

- The speaker expresses admiration for the person they are speaking to and their commitment to making science accessible and useful.

- The podcast is hosted by Andrew Huberman, a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

- The episode focuses on building tenacity and willpower.

- Tenacity is the willingness to persist under pressure and resistance, while willpower involves both motivation to do things and resist certain things.

- The episode explores the psychology and neuroscience of tenacity and willpower, including a brain structure that many neuroscientists are not aware of.

- Research-supported tools for enhancing tenacity and willpower are discussed.

- The podcast is separate from the speaker's teaching and research roles at Stanford.

- The podcast aims to provide free information about science and science-related tools to the general public.

- The transcript discusses the importance of enhancing tenacity and willpower.

- It mentions that there is a specific brain center that generates tenacity and willpower.

- Understanding the psychology of tenacity and willpower, coupled with the underlying neural mechanism, can help tailor protocols for enhancing them.

- Tenacity and willpower can be distinguished from habit execution, as they require effort and intervention in default neural processes.

- A continuum is described, with tenacity and willpower on one end and apathy and depression on the other, and motivation is the engine that allows movement along this continuum.

- The psychology of willpower has been studied for over a hundred years.

- Willpower is believed by some to be a limited resource that can be depleted with each decision and effort to resist certain behaviors.

- The concept of ego depletion is used to describe the depletion of willpower.

- There is controversy surrounding the idea of willpower as a limited resource, with conflicting evidence and conclusions from different researchers.

- Understanding the theory of willpower as a limited resource is important in order to understand the controversy and explore the underlying neural mechanisms and tools for increasing tenacity and willpower.

- The transcript discusses the importance of modulators in increasing tenacity and willpower.

- The autonomic nervous system, specifically the sympathetic and parasympathetic components, plays a role in generating states of alertness and relaxation.

- The balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems affects our level of tenacity and willpower.

- Factors such as sleep deprivation, physical and emotional pain, and distraction can diminish our ability to call on tenacity and willpower.

- Taking care of foundational modulators, such as sleep and stress management, is crucial for consistently engaging tenacity and willpower.

- The speaker has been taking AG1 daily since 2012 and is happy that they are sponsoring the podcast.

- AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that provides foundational nutrition.

- The speaker tries to get enough vitamins and minerals from whole food sources but often can't, so AG1 helps fill that gap.

- AG1 also contains adaptogens to help with stress and improves focus, energy, and sleep.

- The speaker recommends AG1 as the one supplement to take and offers a special offer for trying it.

- The transcript discusses a study by Baumeister and colleagues that suggests willpower is a limited resource.

- In the study, participants were divided into two groups and asked to resist either radishes or cookies.

- Afterwards, they were given a challenging puzzle to solve.

- The study found that those who had to resist the harder temptation (cookies) gave up sooner on the puzzle.

- The conclusion drawn was that willpower is a limited resource, but the exact nature of this resource was not specified.

- Baumeister and colleagues explored the idea that glucose availability in the brain may be the limited resource that affects willpower.

- In experiments, subjects were given difficult tasks that required willpower and then a glucose beverage or a non-glucose drink.

- The studies showed that subjects who consumed glucose maintained or increased their levels of willpower compared to those who did not.

- This finding led to the belief that keeping brain glucose levels stable or elevated could enhance willpower and tenacity.

- However, subsequent studies and meta-analyses raised controversy and questioned the interpretation of the results.

- In 2013, Dr. Carol Dweck conducted a study on willpower and glucose availability for the brain.

- The study involved a difficult task followed by the Stroop task, which tests prefrontal cortex function.

- The results showed that ingesting glucose can improve performance on challenging tasks, but it depends on whether the individual believes willpower is a limited resource and whether they believe glucose is the limiting factor.

- There were three experiments in the study, all supporting the idea that beliefs about willpower determine the impact of glucose on self-control.

- Another researcher, Baumeister, conducted subsequent experiments that countered some of Dweck's findings, but the tools and protocols discussed in the transcript work regardless of which psychological camp one is in.

- Element is an electrolyte drink that contains salt, sodium, magnesium, and potassium.

- It does not contain sugar.

- Increasing sodium intake can improve cognitive and physical function for some people.

- People on low carbohydrate diets may excrete water and electrolytes, so increasing electrolyte intake can help them feel and function better.

- The speaker personally drinks Element in the morning, during physical training, and after using the sauna to replenish electrolytes.

- Tenacity and willpower have a unified source in the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.

- This brain area can be increased in size and activity through plasticity.

- The anterior mid-cingulate cortex receives inputs from various areas, including the autonomic nervous system and reward systems.

- Studies in humans support the role of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex in tenacity and willpower.

- Lesions or disruptions of this brain area result in increased apathy and depression and reduced tenacity and motivation.

- Successful dieters and individuals with learned helplessness show elevated activity in the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.

- Super-agers have a larger anterior mid-cingulate cortex compared to their age-matched peers.

- Willpower can be expressed as either "I will" or "I absolutely won't"

- The brain area responsible for willpower cannot be a simple on/off switch, but rather has graded levels

- The anterior mid-cingulate cortex plays a critical role in generating tenacity and willpower

- It receives and sends input to various brain areas involved in cardiovascular function, respiration, immune system, and endocrine system

- The anterior mid-cingulate cortex is also connected to premotor centers and reward pathways in the brain

- Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett argues that the anterior mid-cingulate cortex is a major seat for tenacity and willpower.

- Lisa's laboratory has conducted pioneering research on emotion and affect.

- Dr. Huberman encourages listeners to listen to the upcoming episode with Dr. Feldman Barrett.

- Dr. Joe Parvizi conducted a study where stimulation of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex in human subjects created a sensation of pressure and the need to resist.

- The anterior mid-cingulate cortex acts as a hub that receives information from various brain areas and generates a sense of resistance and the need to marshal resources.

- The anterior mid-cingulate cortex is not just responsible for allocating energy and activation to different brain areas, but also receives input from the brain and body.

- Moving the body activates the anterior mid-cingulate cortex, and it is further activated when we force or encourage ourselves to move.

- The anterior mid-cingulate cortex is also activated when engaging in challenging tasks, and its activity is elevated during hard tasks.

- The anterior mid-cingulate cortex can be built up through specific behaviors that we may not want to engage in and by resisting behaviors we are drawn to.

- Building up the anterior mid-cingulate cortex's capacity for tenacity and willpower carries over into other challenging aspects of life.

- The anterior mid-cingulate cortex is important for generating tenacity and willpower.

- Cardiovascular exercise can increase brain volume in aging humans.

- A study compared cardiovascular exercise to calisthenics/stretching in individuals aged 60 to 79.

- The group that did cardiovascular training saw maintenance or increases in the size of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex and anterior white matter tracts.

- Compliance with the three hours per week of cardiovascular training was high.

- Engaging in cardiovascular exercise can increase the size of the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.

- Activities like calisthenics and stretching do not have the same effect on the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.

- Engaging in exercise and movement activates the anterior mid-cingulate cortex, which is responsible for tenacity and willpower.

- Resistance training and cardiovascular training are important for maintaining muscle strength, which is correlated with cognitive function.

- Incorporating "micro sucks" into routines, such as adding an extra set or doing an additional challenging task, can help build tenacity and willpower.

- It is important to choose safe tasks that require effort and resistance to activate the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.

- Building tenacity and willpower should be done in a balanced way to avoid unhealthy behaviors and maintain a healthy relationship with goals and life.

- Engaging in challenging activities and pushing oneself beyond comfort zones can build tenacity and willpower.

- Qualifying exams and puzzles that push individuals to their limits can teach important lessons and build resilience.

- Super agers who maintain cognitive function engage in challenging activities and seek out discomfort.

- The anterior mid-cingulate cortex plays a role in the will to live and is associated with tenacity and willpower.

- Engaging in activities that require resistance and self-control can strengthen the circuits associated with tenacity and willpower.

- The capacity for tenacity and willpower can be built up based on psychology and neuroscience literature.

- A study in animals showed that the relief felt after successfully withstanding stress serves as a reward and reinforces tenacity and willpower.

- Rewarding oneself occasionally after engaging in challenging behavior can further reinforce tenacity and willpower.

- Rewards should be subjective and health-promoting, not given regularly or every time.

- There will be a toolkit episode and a link to a published paper provided for those interested in learning more about rewarding tenacity and willpower.

- Tenacity and willpower are limited resources that may be related to ego depletion and glucose consumption.

- Sleep deprivation, pain, emotional pain, and distractions diminish tenacity and willpower.

- The anterior mid-cingulate cortex is a brain structure that generates tenacity and willpower.

- Engaging in activities that require tenacity and willpower can strengthen the anterior mid-cingulate cortex.

- Building up tenacity and willpower can have positive effects on cognitive learning and physical exercise.

- Task switching is a common challenge for many people.

- The prefrontal cortex is responsible for directing focus and cognition in a context-dependent way.

- Cognitive flexibility allows for switching between different types of cognitive operations.

- Introducing short transition gaps between tasks can improve task switching efficiency.

- Even a short transition period of 15 seconds can improve task execution on the next task.

- During the transition period, it is important to avoid introducing new information or distractions.

- Limiting task switching and focusing on a dedicated transition from task A to task B can improve productivity.

- Music is a neurological phenomenon that activates nearly every part of the brain.

- Listening to music involves the brain and body becoming part of the instrument that contributes to our perception of the music.

- Different types of music activate different neural circuits in the brain, creating different brain and bodily states.

- Music can be leveraged to shift brain states, enhance learning and memory, and enhance brain plasticity.

- It is best to listen to music in between bouts of work or during brief rest periods, rather than while working.

- The podcast is separate from the speaker's teaching and research roles at Stanford.

- The podcast aims to provide free information about science and science-related tools to the general public.

- Music cannot describe physical objects or actions like language can, but it can beautifully describe and evoke emotions with nuance.

- There is scientific evidence to suggest that music evolved before spoken language, and singing and dance may have evolved before language as well.

- Music has the ability to evoke empathy, even without lyrics, by creating a sense of understanding and connection with others.

- When we listen to music, our neurons and hormones respond to the frequencies of sound, creating a symphony of emotion within our bodies and brains.

- Music has a powerful impact on our emotions and can make us feel lifted or experience a sense of lightness.

- Music can explain and evoke emotions, as well as imply intent.

- Different frequencies and patterns of sound in music can evoke different types of bodily movements.

- Babies as young as three months old respond to music with rhythmic movements of their limbs and torso.

- The neural circuits in the brain that respond to music are closely connected to the neural circuits that generate movement in the body.

- The study of babies' responses to music suggests that certain frequencies of sound evoke different types of bodily movements.

- Music can evoke emotions, convey intent, and generate action within us.

- Listening to music for 10 to 30 minutes per day can lead to significant shifts in bodily physiology, such as reduced resting heart rate and increased heart rate variability.

- Heart rate variability reflects the balance between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, and music activates the parasympathetic aspect, leading to periods of relaxation and calm.

- The positive effects of listening to music on health are likely due to changes in breathing patterns, specifically respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

- Music can impact our physiology at a deep level, even below our conscious awareness, by turning the knobs of our cardiovascular system and breathing apparatus.

- The speaker has been taking AG1 daily since 2012 and is happy that they are sponsoring the podcast.

- AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that provides foundational nutrition.

- The speaker tries to get enough vitamins and minerals from whole food sources but often can't, so AG1 helps fill that gap.

- AG1 also contains adaptogens to help with stress and improves focus, energy, and sleep.

- There is a special offer for listeners to try AG1 at drinkag1.com/huberman, which includes five free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

- Music has a powerful effect on evoking physiological responses in the brain and body.

- Many people seek ways to increase motivation and sustain it over time.

- Listening to music activates premotor and motor circuits in the brain, which can increase motivation.

- Music activates various neural circuits and releases neurochemicals, influencing the likelihood of neuron activity.

- The frontal cortex is involved in understanding context and making predictions, and it is activated when listening to music.

- The frontal cortex plays a predictive role in anticipating the next song in an album or mixtape.

- The release of dopamine is linked to the brain's prediction machinery and the sense of novelty in music.

- Listening to music activates brain circuits associated with novelty, such as the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens.

- Music also activates brain areas involved in arousal, memory encoding, and emotional responses, such as the amygdala, parahippocampal formation, cortex, and hippocampus.

- Music has the ability to evoke strong memories and emotions, creating a rich and complex experience.

- There are two brain circuits, the basal ganglia and the cerebellum, that are activated by music and are involved in regulating movement.

- Listening to music creates a propensity for action and evokes the activation of various brain circuits.

- Music with a faster cadence, around 140 to 150 beats per minute, can create a heightened state of motivation to move.

- Music can evoke the release of neurochemicals that shift the body towards being more likely to move.

- Listening to faster music prior to engaging in work or exercise can increase motivation.

- Binaural beats can enhance concentration and focus, specifically at a frequency of 40 Hertz.

- However, recent studies show that binaural beats can also impede concentration and cognitive performance, but these studies did not use 40 Hertz binaural beats specifically.

- White noise and brown noise can also be used for cognitive focus.

- There are free apps and YouTube scripts available for listening to binaural beats.

- The speaker personally uses white noise, brown noise, 40 Hertz binaural beats, classical music, or works in silence to enhance focus.

- Controlled studies show that people perform best on cognitive tasks in complete silence.

- The second best condition is to have instrumental music playing in the background.

- People perform even worse when listening to music with lyrics while doing cognitive work.

- Previous studies have shown that white noise, brown noise, and 40 Hertz binaural beats can improve focus and cognitive performance.

- If listening to music while working, it is best to choose purely instrumental music that is somewhat faster than 140 to 150 beats per minute.

- The speaker does not use a teleprompter for podcasting and instead relies on bullet pointed notes.

- They were taught a method in university to read and retain information by listening to the words in their head as if they were being spoken.

- The speaker is curious about others' processes of reading and retaining information, specifically whether they include an internal dialogue.

- The brain generates premotor activity when reading, but the signals are typically just below the threshold of actually speaking the words.

- When the speaker says they listen to the words in their head while reading, they mean that they are just shy of saying the words out loud.

- Listening to music prior to a task can help with motivation.

- For cognitive tasks that require reading and concentration, silence or specific types of noise (40 Hertz binaural beats, white noise, or brown noise) are best.

- If listening to music, instrumental music without lyrics is preferable.

- Listening to music with lyrics, especially familiar and uplifting songs, can enhance cognition and performance when used during breaks from cognitive work.

- Taking breaks during cognitive work and listening to music during those breaks can increase focus and learning ability when returning to the task.

- The impact of music on physical performance is mixed according to studies.

- The type of physical exercise and individual preferences play a role in the effectiveness of music.

- Listening to faster, upbeat music during rest periods or intermittently during exercise can enhance performance.

- Switching between silence and music, particularly familiar and motivating music, can be beneficial.

- There is no one-size-fits-all approach, and individuals can experiment with different variables to find what works best for them.

- Music has the ability to shift our mood and alleviate anxiety.

- The components of music, such as frequency, cadence, and lyrics, activate brain circuits and evoke the firing of neurons in the brain.

- Certain frequencies of sound in music release neurochemicals in the brain, creating emotional states.

- The auditory system and circuits in the brain that respond to music have a strong ability to evoke emotional states.

- Surveys show that people listen to music to relax, make themselves happy, process emotions (often sadness), and increase concentration.

- Music that makes people happy tends to be faster, with 140 to 150 beats per minute or faster.

- Happy music is often in a major key and may have lyrics about positive events or total nonsense.

- The cadence of music is the critical variable in shifting one's mood.

- One hit wonders are often uplifting songs that improve people's mood.

- AI is being used to generate new songs based on the rules of how music impacts the brain.

- Listening to particular sounds activates premotor and motor circuits in the brain and body, as well as facial microstructures related to emotion.

- There is a direct relationship between the frequency and cadence of a sound and facial expressions.

- Low frequency bass tones played spaced apart from each other can evoke a specific facial expression known as "bass face."

- These circuits and facial expressions are fundamental components of communication and have likely been used by humans for thousands of years.

- There are many quality studies exploring how music impacts the brain and mood states.

- Listening to happy music for at least nine minutes can significantly shift one's mood into a happier state.

- To process somber or sad feelings, listening to sad music for 13 minutes or more can help people move past their feelings of sadness.

- The effectiveness of feeling and expressing emotions through music is a topic that should be explored further in a separate podcast episode.

- The use of catharsis, amplifying emotional expression or feeling, can help individuals move through states of sadness.

- Giving oneself a period of time to listen to sad music can be a helpful approach in processing feelings of sadness.

- Music can be used to shift states of happiness, sadness, and anxiety.

- The physiological sigh is a breathing technique that effectively reduces anxiety in real time.

- A study from the University of Pennsylvania showed that listening to the song "Weightless" by Marconi Union can reduce anxiety by up to 65% in just three minutes.

- This reduction in anxiety is comparable to the effects of benzodiazepines.

- The song "Weightless" has gained popularity on YouTube, with a 10-hour version receiving 47 million views.

- The speaker shares a personal story about being encouraged to play the violin as a child but ultimately quitting due to lack of skill.

- Learning to play an instrument at a young age, especially before the age of eight, leads to enhanced brain connectivity that persists into adulthood.

- Learning multiple instruments and singing along with instrumentals further enhances brain connectivity.

- Learning an instrument and singing are a gateway to neuroplasticity, which enhances learning and the acquisition of new skills.

- Listening to novel forms of music, especially when paying attention to it, also expands the brain's capacity for neuroplasticity.

- The topic of music in the brain is vast and complex.

- Music has the ability to tap into our neural circuitry and affect our emotional and motivational states.

- Music can be leveraged to shift emotional and motivational states.

- There is more to explore regarding the formal structure of music and its relationship to brain function, as well as singing and songwriting.

- Music has the power to activate the brain and there are specific areas dedicated to processing music.

- The Huberman Lab Podcast discusses science and science-based tools for everyday life.

- The episode focuses on goal-setting and achieving goals, incorporating information from previous episodes and new scientific literature.

- The episode covers selecting goals, measuring progress, sustaining motivation, and dispelling myths about goal-setting.

- The podcast is separate from the speaker's teaching and research roles at Stanford.

- The podcast is aimed at providing free science-related information to the general public.

- The podcast is sponsored by Eight Sleep and Maui Nui Venison, offering products related to sleep and high-quality protein respectively.

- Goal setting and pursuit involve neural circuitry in the brain, including the amygdala, basal ganglia, lateral prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex.

- The amygdala is involved in arousal, fear, anxiety, and positive valence experiences.

- The basal ganglia has pathways for generating actions (go pathway) and withholding actions (no-go pathway).

- The lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in planning, and the orbitofrontal cortex evaluates emotional and arousal states related to goal pursuit.

- All humans have the same neural circuitry for goal setting and pursuit, regardless of the type of goal.

- Trying to achieve multiple goals simultaneously often leads to failure.

- It is important to select one priority goal and focus on it, while still maintaining engagement with other aspects of life.

- Setting a challenging goal that feels slightly out of reach is more likely to lead to success than setting an easy goal.

- Discomfort, frustration, and anxiety are necessary for neuroplasticity and learning.

- Deep sleep and rest are important for the rewiring of neural circuits that lead to improved performance.

- Before pursuing a goal, it is important to define specific verbs or actions involved in achieving that goal.

- Writing down goals and actions on paper is more effective than typing on a phone.

- Setting specific and measurable goals, along with defining the actions and time commitment, significantly increases the probability of success.

- Setting a Post-it note with a goal and leaving it in the same place every day diminishes the likelihood of progress because our visual system adapts to regular stimuli.

- To effectively use visual reminders, change them daily and place them in different locations.

- The common myth of the "post-it fallacy" suggests that writing down a goal on a post-it and leaving it in a frequented area increases adherence, but this is not true.

- The myth of accountability suggests that telling others about your goals can actually decrease your motivation and likelihood of achieving them.

- Positive feedback from others activates reward systems in the brain, but this quickly diminishes, reducing the probability of taking action towards the goal.

- Instead, it is better to keep your goals to yourself or share them with someone who doubts you, as this activates the friction circuitry and can increase motivation.

- The friction model of achieving goals can be effective in motivating oneself.

- However, there is a danger in approaching goals with the intention of proving someone else wrong, as it can shift the focus away from achieving the goal itself.

- Intrinsic motivation, which is directly attached to the task at hand, is the most powerful and sustainable source of motivation.

- The final protocol for goal setting is to make the goal measurable by defining the overall time frame and the amount of time spent each week or day.

- It is recommended to establish a 12-week cycle to focus on the goal, with specific hours per week and per day, and designated days for pursuing the goal.

- Writing down the goal and the specific actions with a pen or pencil reinforces the goal setting process and increases the likelihood of achieving the goals.

- Goals can be quantifiable or more loosely defined, depending on the endeavor.

- For quantifiable goals, breaking them down into smaller milestones can help track progress.

- For goals that are not easily quantifiable, it is important to be precise about the amount of time spent on specific actions to make progress.

- The best protocol for initiating goal pursuit depends on whether you are motivated or unmotivated.

- If you are motivated, spend 1-3 minutes visualizing the positive outcomes of achieving the goal.

- If you are unmotivated, spend 1-3 minutes visualizing the negative consequences of not achieving the goal.

- Regular blood work is important for understanding factors that impact immediate and long-term health.

- InsideTracker provides a personalized platform to easily understand blood test results and offers protocols to adjust numbers for optimal health.

- Consider the specific time domain to sustain effort during goal pursuit.

- Use tools, such as visualization techniques, to stay motivated within a training or practice block.

- Maintaining focus is crucial during a learning block, and visual focus can be used to increase or maintain motivation.

- Incorporating visual target training into learning bouts can enhance focus, motivation, and goal achievement.

- Tim Ferriss' list of 30 things he wished he knew when he was 20 is impressive and relevant.

- The best productivity app is already on your phone - put it on airplane mode or turn it off to remove distractions.

- Don't have your phone facing up with wifi and cellular service on if you want to be productive. Turn it over, turn it off, or put it in another room.

- Dopamine is the molecule of motivation and plays a role in goal pursuit and wellbeing.

- Rewarding yourself every time you reach a milestone diminishes the potency of the reward and reduces motivation over time.

- Incorporating random intermittent reinforcement, like flipping a coin to decide whether to reward yourself, helps maintain ongoing motivation.

- The "middle problem" refers to a decrease in motivation and focus during the middle of pursuing a goal.

- Acknowledging the middle problem and breaking up the middle section into smaller chunks can help overcome it.

- This approach can be applied to both short learning bouts and longer periods of effort, such as weekly training sessions.

- There are three times during the day when focus and attention are highest: 30 minutes, three hours, and 11 hours after waking up.

- These times are related to circadian rhythms and shifts in body temperature and neurochemical release.

- While it's valuable to schedule goal pursuit during these times, it's important to be flexible and prioritize actually engaging in the pursuit.

- Our subjective feelings of energy and wellbeing during the day are influenced by how positively we view our previous day's experiences and how positively we view our next day's pursuits and experiences.

- Completing tasks we set for ourselves leaves us with a feeling of accomplishment, which can increase our energy levels.

- It is important to set specific, quantifiable goals and take action to achieve them.

- Growth mindset is a concept in psychology that involves embracing challenge and optimizing performance.

- It is important to distance your identity from your performance to avoid undermining your performance.

- Combining growth mindset with a stress-enhancing mindset can greatly improve performance in any endeavor.

- The podcast is separate from the speaker's teaching and research roles at Stanford.

- The podcast aims to provide free information about science and science-related tools to the general public.

- The podcast is sponsored by Eight Sleep, which offers smart mattress covers, and Roka, which sells high-quality eyeglasses and sunglasses.

- Growth mindset is the belief that abilities can improve through effort and learning.

- Neuroplasticity allows the brain to change and learn throughout life.

- Mindsets are mental frames that organize and encode information, and they include narratives that shape our beliefs about our abilities.

- The transcript discusses the importance of understanding one's strengths and weaknesses and how they are tied to one's identity.

- It highlights research that shows how feedback based on intelligence labels can undermine motivation and performance, while feedback based on effort can lead to better performance.

- The transcript emphasizes the need for parents and teachers to be cautious about attaching identity labels to a child's performance and instead focus on praising effort.

- In a study, children who received effort praise performed better on cognitive problems compared to those who received intelligence praise or no specific praise.

- Children who received intelligence praise tended to pick easier problems and took on fewer challenges overall, while those who received effort praise opted for harder challenges and took on more challenges.

- Children who received intelligence praise were more likely to misrepresent their performance on subsequent tasks, while those who received effort praise faithfully represented their performance.

- In 1996, 85% of parents believed that intelligence was fixed, but now we understand that the brain can learn and intelligence is not fixed.

- Feedback about our performance, even when it's good, can undermine future performance, while effort praise can improve abilities.

- Anyone can improve their scores on intelligence tests through dedicated effort, and this paper was ahead of its time in seeding the field of growth mindset.

- The speaker encourages listeners to reflect on their strengths and weaknesses and how they arrived at those conclusions.

- They suggest shifting from performance-based narratives to effort-related narratives.

- The purpose of this exercise is to gain insight into the tools needed to improve and avoid regression in areas of interest.

- Attaching performance labels to our abilities can lead to a fixed mindset and a sense of identity tied to our performance.

- Focusing on effort and verbs instead of ability and performance allows for continuous improvement and growth.

- Engaging in effort processes such as practicing, analyzing errors, and persisting can be applied to various domains and is central to our identity.

- AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink that provides foundational nutrition and helps buffer stress.

- The speaker has been taking AG1 daily since 2012 and feels better with increased focus, energy, and improved sleep.

- AG1 is offering a special offer of 10 free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3K2 if you go to drinkag1.com/huberman.

- Labels of intelligence or identity undermine performance, whether given before or after a task.

- Effort-based praise can improve performance before and after a task.

- It is important to give praise that is correctly attached to genuine effort, as effort is something that can be controlled.

- The transcript discusses a study by Carol Dweck and colleagues on the effects of effort praise and intelligence praise on performance and learning.

- The study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to measure brain activity and found that individuals with a growth mindset responded to errors by focusing on cognitive appraisal, while those with a fixed mindset had a greater emotional response.

- The findings suggest that a growth mindset, which values effort and learning, leads to higher performance compared to a fixed mindset.

- Shifting from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset is important when dealing with mistakes and failures.

- Focusing attention on understanding and analyzing errors can help develop a growth mindset.

- Building a practice of focusing on effort and analyzing errors is the cornerstone of developing a growth mindset.

- InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes blood and DNA data to help understand the body and meet health goals.

- Regular blood work is important for understanding factors that impact immediate and long-term health.

- InsideTracker provides a personalized platform to easily understand blood test results and offers protocols to adjust numbers for optimal health.

- Growth mindset is about connecting motivation to cognition and specific thought processes that can be controlled.

- The stress is enhancing mindset, discovered by Dr. Ali Crum, shows that how we think about stress impacts our reaction to it.

- People who believe stress enhances performance actually experience performance improvement, even in tasks that are not very challenging.

- Stress doesn't always lead to improved performance and often diminishes it.

- Embracing a stress-enhancing mindset allows for real-time adjustment of the stress response and increased focus on analyzing errors.

- When stress is viewed as enhancing, cortisol release is shorter, stroke volume increases, and cognition improves under stress.

- Dr. David Yeager's work on growth mindset and stress-enhancing mindset shows that teaching students about these mindsets improves performance in various real-world contexts.

- A study published in Nature found that educating students on growth mindset and stress-enhancing mindset reduces anticipatory stress and improves performance.

- Learning about these mindsets allows students to shift their physiology and psychology, seeing stress as an opportunity for challenge and improving their performance.

- The study used a brief 30-minute intervention to promote growth mindset and stress as a performance-enhancer.

- The tutorial included information about neuroscience and neuroplasticity, emphasizing that struggle and frustration are signs of learning and expanding limits.

- The intervention led to a 40% improvement in self-regard, a 14% improvement in passing challenging courses, and increased willingness to take on difficult challenges in the future.

- Adopting a growth mindset and a stress-enhances-performance mindset is beneficial for both teachers and students.

- Understanding the difference between growth mindset and fixed mindset, as well as how stress can enhance performance, is important.

- Teachers viewing students as less fixed in their abilities and students viewing themselves as less fixed in their abilities is a positive outcome of adopting these mindsets.

- When giving praise or feedback, focus on verbs instead of labels.

- It is important to use this approach when giving feedback on good performance.

- When analyzing errors, focus on the verbs that led to those errors rather than negative labels.

- Seeking help from others is a key tool for analyzing errors and improving performance.

- High performers tend to seek help to understand why they didn't perform well.

- Getting input from others can provide additional perspectives on both poor and good performance.

- Growth mindset and stress-enhanced performance mindset are most effective when both teachers and students embrace them.

- If there is no teacher or mentor available, individuals can serve as their own teacher by writing a letter explaining growth mindset and stress-enhanced performance mindset to someone else.

- This simple exercise of writing a letter has been shown to improve performance in the short term and future.

- The mind is not exactly like a muscle because when we strain to learn something, we don't immediately experience improved performance like we do when we exercise a muscle.

- Learning involves experiencing stress, frustration, and difficulty maintaining focus, which actually create the conditions for learning.

- Adopting a growth mindset and a stress-enhancing performance mindset can improve performance synergistically, but cultivating these mindsets takes time.

- The discussion is about growth mindset and how to cultivate it, as well as the stress-enhancing performance mindset.

- Dr. Maya Shankar, a cognitive scientist and former senior advisor to the White House, is the guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

- Identity formation is influenced by observation of successful individuals and societal expectations.

- Identity can be tied to what we do and what we believe.

- When faced with a loss of identity, it is important to anchor our identity to why we do things rather than what we do, and to find the underlying features that bring us joy and connection.

- Childhood identities can be projected onto children, potentially limiting their self-perception and future choices.

- Adolescents and teens often question their identity, seeking independence and breaking away from imposed structures.

- Believing in immutable essences can lead to shame and self-criticism, while embracing a growth mindset allows for personal growth and self-improvement.

- The speaker discusses the neural circuits in the brain that divide sensory experiences into yum, yuck, and meh.

- The speaker acknowledges that we often lack complete self-knowledge and suggests ways to gain better understanding of ourselves, such as seeking mentorship and honest assessments from others.

- They emphasize the importance of surrounding ourselves with diverse people and engaging in uncomfortable conversations to gain self-awareness.

- The speaker believes that feedback from others is valuable and should be integrated into our understanding of ourselves, as it helps us see how we impact others and identify areas for improvement.

- The speaker values humility and a flexible mindset in their approach to work and personal relationships.

- They emphasize the importance of seeking critical feedback and being open to updating one's beliefs and strategies based on new information.

- The speaker discusses distancing techniques, such as viewing problems from a third person perspective, to promote objectivity and reframing in challenging situations.

- There are two parts to a goal: defining the goal and pursuing the goal. The way we frame our goals can have a significant impact on our success. Framing goals in terms of approach orientation (e.g., wanting to eat healthier foods) leads to feelings of pride and accomplishment, boosts motivation, endurance, and perseverance. Framing goals in terms of avoidance orientation (e.g., wanting to avoid unhealthy foods) leads to feelings of calm and relief.

- Approach orientation is generally more motivating than avoidance orientation. Measuring success is easier when goals are framed in terms of approach rather than avoidance. Small tweaks in the way we frame our goals can have a big impact on behavior.

- Changing one word in an email led to a 9% increase in access to a government benefit. The word change from "eligible" to "earned" invoked the endowment effect, making people value the benefit more and increasing their motivation to access it. Small changes in language and framing can have a significant impact on behavior change.

- Setting our own goals and targets increases motivation and a sense of agency.

- People prefer using their own judgment over algorithms, even if the algorithm performs better.

- Building agency and choice into daily programming boosts motivation and ownership of success or failure.

- Being among like-minded people can be helpful for motivation, but it can also limit our frame of mind and prevent us from challenging our own beliefs.

- Our perception of the outside world is strongly influenced by our group affiliations, as shown in a study where fans favored calls that benefited their team.

- To change someone's mind, it is important to show genuine curiosity, ask questions, and ask them what evidence would change their mind, assuming they are open to changing their beliefs.

- The speaker believes that failures in public policy often stem from a lack of understanding and empathy for opposing viewpoints.

- They express frustration with the lack of discussion on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

- The speaker emphasizes the importance of empathy and learning about how the mind works to bridge empathy gaps and improve relationships with others.

- There are three types of empathy: emotional empathy, cognitive empathy, and empathic concern.

- Society tends to value emotional empathy more, but all three types should be valued equally.

- Cultivating cognitive empathy and empathic concern can protect against burnout for those with high emotional empathy.

- The speaker discusses the importance of setting goals when in the same psychological and physiological state as when pursuing them.

- It is helpful to build in an emergency reserve or slack into goal setting to allow for flexibility and prevent frustration.

- Capitalizing on fresh starts, such as milestone moments or the beginning of a new year, can be a powerful motivator for introducing new habits and patterns.

- The middle problem refers to the decrease in motivation during the pursuit of a goal.

- Shortening the time duration of goals can help maintain motivation.

- Temptation bundling, pairing an unpleasant activity with an immediately rewarding one, can also help keep motivation high.

- Reflecting on the peak and end of an experience can influence how we remember it.

- Elongating an unpleasant experience but making the last few minutes slightly less unpleasant can lead to a more positive impression of the overall experience.

- Tailoring these recommendations to individual preferences and psychology is important.

- Tim Ferriss' Saisei Foundation funds small bets in science, such as the Hopkins treatment-resistant depression pilot study and the Ferris UC Berkeley Journalism Fellowship for up-and-coming journalists to focus on psychedelics as their beat.

- The foundation also funds the development of curricula for psychiatry MD programs at Yale, Johns Hopkins, and NYU to administer psychedelic assist therapies if and when they become legal and prescribable.

- Ferriss believes in executing plans logically and breaking down the psychedelic ecosystem into its critical few parts, rather than trying to do all the things at once.

- Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive technique that can enhance neuroplasticity and be used as a monotherapy for depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.

- Psychedelics have cross efficacy with multiple conditions, but can be contraindicated for certain people with chaotic conditions like schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder.

- Metabolic psychiatry, including the use of ketosis and the ketogenic diet, appears to be effective for patients with chaotic conditions. There is a need for more research and exploration in the field of psychiatry.

1. Mental training and visualization have been studied since the late 1800s.

2. Neuroplasticity encompasses developmental plasticity and adult neuroplasticity.

3. Adult neuroplasticity is self-directed adaptive plasticity that can be directed towards specific desired learning.

4. Developmental plasticity occurs between birth and age 25 and is passive plasticity.

5. Self-directed adaptive plasticity can start in adolescence and allows individuals to decide what they want to learn.

- Learning requires focused, dedicated attention to trigger chemical and electrical processes in the brain.

- This attention may cause agitation and frustration, which is a normal signal that learning is happening.

- The second component required for learning is periods of deep rest, particularly a good night's sleep.

- Neuroplasticity, the rearrangement of connections between neurons, occurs during sleep, particularly on the first night following focused attention to learning.

- Second and third night effects can also contribute to learning if good sleep is achieved.

- Self-directed adaptive plasticity occurs when we learn and sleep well repeatedly.

- There are different forms of plasticity between neurons, including long-term potentiation and long-term depression.

- Long-term depression is not necessarily bad and can be excellent for learning motor skills.

- Long-term depression involves eliminating incorrect movements to arrive at only the correct movements in a reflexive and repeated way.

- Mental training and visualization protocols can capture both the potentiation and depression aspect of neuroplasticity and serve as a compliment to real-world cognitive and physical training.

- Mental training and visualization can activate the visual and auditory cortex in the brain.

- Most people can visualize simple stimuli like a yellow cube and a red rose, or a short musical motif.

- Long and elaborate visualizations are harder to imagine and repeat accurately.

- Mental training and visualization should be kept short and simple, lasting about 15-20 seconds, and repeated often for best results.

- People with aphantasia, or the inability to mentally visualize, may need to keep their visualizations even simpler and shorter.

- Athletic Greens is a sponsor of the podcast and provides a vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

- The drink contains probiotics that are important for gut health and microbiotic health.

- It also contains adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals to meet foundational nutritional needs.

- The website athleticgreens.com/huberman offers five free travel packs and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2 for those interested in trying Athletic Greens.

- Mental visualization is studied by researchers such as Roger Shepard and Stephen Kosslyn.

- Shepard found that the time it takes to mentally visualize an object increases with its complexity, especially when rotating it.

- Kosslyn's experiment showed that the time it takes to mentally move from one location to another on a map is directly proportional to the physical distance between those locations.

- Mental visualization and real-world experiences activate the same neurons and have the same spatial relationships, but real-world experiences are more effective for learning and improving performance.

1. Mental training and visualization can be effective, but are most effective when combined with real-world training and experiences.

2. Bistable images and impossible figures are used in experiments to study visual perception.

3. It is impossible to imagine bistable images in our mind's eye, but we can do it if we trace or draw them first.

4. Mental training and visualization are more effective when combined with real-world behaviors and experiences that are similar.

5. Mental training and visualization are not a replacement for real-world motor or cognitive training, but an addition that can help.

1. Assigning cognitive labels to mental training and visualization makes it more effective.

2. The human brain is exceptionally good at recognizing and processing faces.

3. Cognitive labels and accurate visualization are important for effective mental training and should match real-world experiences.

4. Naming and giving an identity to a real-world skill and applying the same name or identity to the mental version of that can enhance mental training and visualization.

1. Mental training and visualization captures many features of real-world behavior and perceptions.

2. Eye movements behind closed eyelids can indicate what a person is imagining.

3. Processing time is longer for small objects than for large objects in mental imagery.

4. Mental imagery is equivalent to real-world perception and behavior.

5. Deliberately moving your eyes in the direction of what you are visualizing can enhance the effectiveness of mental training and visualization.

- There are five principles of mental training and visualization that are well-established from scientific research literature.

- A systematic review of studies on motor imagery training elements in different disciplines found that brief, simple, and repeated visualization is effective, with 50-75 repetitions per session and 15-second rest periods.

- Mental training and visualization can increase the accuracy and frequency of real-world behaviors, but it is important to be able to successfully complete the behavior in the real world first.

- Performing mental training and visualization sessions 3-5 times per week is effective, and once a behavior is consolidated in the neural circuits, it does not need to be maintained with mental training and visualization.

- InsideTracker now includes a measurement of apolipoprotein B (ApoB), a key marker of cardiovascular health.

- Use the code "Huberman" to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

- Real-world training is more effective than mental training, but mental training is more effective than no training.

- Mental training can help maintain or improve skills for those who are injured or unable to perform physical training.

- Combining real-world training with mental training can bring about greater results than either one alone.

- Adding even half an hour of mental training to 10 hours of real-world training can significantly improve performance.

- Building skills through physical and mental training requires focused attention and rest/sleep.

- Mental training can be done on the same day as physical training, but it's important to prioritize getting good sleep.

- Getting sufficient amounts of quality sleep is important for ensuring neuroplasticity occurs following both real-world and mental training.

- Sleep is critical for consolidating certain types of learning, especially motor skill acquisition and retention.

- A paper by Matthew Walker titled "Sleep and Timecourse of Motor Skill Learning" highlights the importance of sleep in consolidating motor learning.

- Sex differences in mental visualization and training have been explored, but subsequent studies show no significant differences between males and females.

- Age-related differences have also been explored, and for individuals 65 or older, a combination of physical and mental training may be more effective than physical training alone.

- For the majority of people, physical training is more effective than mental training, but a combination of both is even better as long as the mental training is on top of the maximum amount of physical training that one can do.

- Mental training is still more effective than no training at all.

- First-person mental training and visualization is generally more effective than third-person mental training and visualization.

- If what you're trying to learn doesn't lend itself well to first-person visualization, closing your eyes and trying to perform the task is effective.

- Watching videos of yourself doing a task can be effective, especially if you're trying to get better at public speaking.

- Brief and repeated mental training and visualization is key to building and consolidating skills.

- Real third-person visualization, where you're actually seeing and/or hearing yourself on a screen, is more effective than imagining yourself from a third-person perspective in your mind's eye.

- Mental training and visualization can be done with eyes open, not just closed.

- The cerebellum communicates with the primary motor cortex and can inhibit or activate it.

- Mental practice can enhance the net excitation of cerebellum to motor cortex communication, reducing inhibition and improving motor skill performance.

- A study showed that mental practice of a simple motor sequence improved speed and accuracy in the real world, and reduced inhibition in the cerebellum to motor cortex communication.

- Mental training and visualization can improve motor skill performance, but require an ability to perform the specific motor sequence in the real world first.

- Motor sequences involve both a "go" action and a "withhold" action

- Mental training and visualization can improve both aspects of motor performance

- The basal ganglia are involved in go vs. no-go tasks and learning

- Restricting inappropriate movements or thoughts is a significant part of motor learning

- Mental training and visualization can improve the no-go aspect of motor learning.

- The stop signal task is a laboratory task that mimics action and cognitive learning in the real world.

- The task involves pressing keys in response to left or right-facing arrows, but also requires participants to withhold pressing a key when a stop signal is presented.

- A study found that a combination of physical and mental training improved response inhibition in the stop signal task more than physical or mental training alone.

- The study suggests that a combination of physical and mental training is especially important for learning to withhold inappropriate actions.

- The training was performed five times over five days, and improvements were significant and occurred quickly.

- Aphantasia is a phenomenon where some people can't generate visual imagery.

- People with aphantasia can have varying degrees of the condition.

- Aphantasia is linked to weak visual imagery and features associated with the autism spectrum.

- There is a relationship between one's ability to generate visual imagery and certain constellations of cognitive and emotional perception and behavior.

- The podcast discussed the key components of effective mental training and visualization practice, including brief epochs and simple sequences of motor and cognitive behavior.

- Mental training and visualization should be repeated over time to improve plasticity of plasticity.

- Actual execution of specific movements and cognitive tasks in the real world is important for effective mental training and visualization.

- Mental training is a reasonable substitute for real-world training if unable to do so, but not a complete substitute.

- A combination of physical training and mental training is best for withholding action to get better at a skill.

- Mental training and visualization is effective for improving real-world performance, even with simple repeats three to five times per week.

- Endurance is about fatigue management and fueling

- Exercise for three reasons: feeling better, looking a certain way, and being able to do it for a long time

- Improve endurance by improving mechanics, such as breathing techniques, posture, and movement technique

- Nasal breathing is a cheat code for improving breathing mechanics

- Strategic breathing pattern and approach is a quick solution for endurance

- Steady state long duration exercise and higher intensity interval training should both be practiced to maximize cardiorespiratory fitness and cognitive benefits.

- Exercise snacks, such as running up a flight of stairs or doing jumping jacks, can be done in as little as 20 seconds and can improve postplandial glucose control, insulin, and other biological markers.

- Exercise does not need to be done exactly as prescribed; multiple times a day, try to get your heart rate up quickly without a warmup.

- Podcast is separate from Stanford and Cal State Fullerton teaching and research roles

- Momentus is the first sponsor, offering high quality single ingredient supplements that ship internationally

- Levels is a program that provides real-time feedback on blood glucose levels

- Element is an electrolyte drink with a science-backed ratio of sodium, potassium, and magnesium, and no sugar

- Endurance is more than just physical activity; it includes energy throughout the day, muscular endurance, maximum anaerobic capacity, maximum aerobic capacity, sustained position, and maximum distance.

- Endurance is about feeling good after an activity, not just being able to do it.

- Fatigue management and energy production are key components of endurance.

- To optimize performance, it is important to identify where you are failing in each category.

- Calories in vs. calories out governs weight loss/gain

- Body fat is stored in white adipose tissue and is released as a fuel source when other fuel sources are depleted

- Fat is lost through respiration, as oxygen is inhaled and carbon dioxide is exhaled

- Plants and humans have a carbon cycle of life, where plants inhale carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen, and humans inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide

- Carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are all chains of carbon, and metabolism is the process of breaking these carbon bonds to release energy

- Oxygen is necessary for metabolism, but is not a fuel source

- Fat loss is achieved by increasing the duration or intensity of exhales

- Carbon intake and exhale is the key metric for fat loss

- Different diets and training protocols can be effective for fat loss

- Steady state exercise, lifting weights, and intervals can all increase respiration rate and help with fat loss

- Hyperventilation training can increase adrenaline levels, but can be difficult to sustain

- Increasing demand for energy is necessary to achieve a negative state for fat loss

- Increasing lung capacity is not a good goal for fat loss

- Cardiac output is heart rate multiplied by stroke volume

- Resting heart rate is a metric to measure physical fitness

- Resting heart rate should be below 60 beats per minute

- Endurance training lowers resting heart rate and increases stroke volume

- Maximum heart rate does not increase with fitness

- Cardiac output adjusts to energy needs

- Athletic Greens is a vitamin, mineral, probiotic and adaptogen drink designed to help meet foundational nutritional needs

- The speaker has been taking Athletic Greens since 2012

- Athletic Greens helps cover vitamins, minerals, and probiotics

- Adaptogens are important for recovering from stress, exercise, work, or life

- Special offer available at athleticgreens.com/Huberman for 5 free travel packs and a year supply of vitamin D3K2

- The ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide increases as exercise intensity increases

- Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) occurs when the ratio exceeds 1.1

- Exercising fasted does not enhance fat loss because there is already enough fuel in the body

- The crossover concept explains that as exercise intensity increases, the percentage of fuel from carbohydrates increases and the percentage of fuel from fat decreases

- Fat-adaptation is a real thing, but it does not maximize fat burning or fat loss

- High-intensity exercise burns 100% carbohydrates and 0% fat

- Fat is used as a fuel source when carbohydrate stores are low

- Burning fat does not equal losing fat from the body; burning body fat stores must be distinguished from burning dietary fat

- High-intensity exercise can reduce body carbohydrate stores

- Combining hypertrophy/muscular endurance strength training with high-intensity exercise can optimize fat loss

- Energy production comes from local exercising muscle, primarily from phosphocreatine and carbohydrate stores

- Blood glucose concentrations rise during exercise

- Muscle glycogen levels can be depleted to 50%, but liver glycogen levels must be depleted to cause a bonk

- The brain sends a signal to stop when the liver is depleted to preserve itself

- Calories in and calories out are not the only factors that determine fat loss.

- You cannot turn fat into muscle, nor muscle into fat.

- When in a sub-caloric state, body fat stores are mobilized to replace glycogen stores that were not filled by the sub-caloric intake.

- Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source and provide flexibility, while fat is an unlimited capacity fuel source.

- When burning muscle glycogen, fat is used as fuel and stored carbohydrates are used to replenish glycogen stores.

- Adding one pound of lean muscle tissue to the body does not equate to a caloric need of X number of calories per day.

- Muscle is more metabolically active at rest than fat, but fat is still going to burn a small number of calories.

- Estimates suggest that adding one pound of muscle spread across the body increases basal metabolic rate by 6-10 calories per day.

- Adding muscle mass can help with fat loss, but regulating calorie intake is more important.

- InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood and DNA to help you better understand your body and reach your health goals.

- Blood tests and DNA tests can provide information about various levels of lipids, hormones, and metabolic factors, but InsideTracker makes it easy to know what to do with that information.

- InsideTracker has a personalized platform that shows what behavioral do's and don'ts, nutritional changes, and supplementation would bring levels into optimal ranges.

- Visit insidetracker.com/Huberman to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

- Metabolic flexibility is the ability to use both carbohydrates and fats as fuel sources.

- Blood glucose levels should be between 80 and 90 milligrams per deciliter, with 85 or lower being ideal.

- AST and ALT levels should be at a ratio of 0.8 or lower.

- Performance should remain consistent when exercising fasted.

- Heart rate recovery should be quick.

- 50 grams of carbohydrates should not cause an energy crash.

- Enhancing fat utilization can be done by eating more fat prior to a workout

- Eating the right combinations of food can help stabilize glucose dysregulation

- Training at a higher intensity and having carbohydrates right before the workout can help improve carbohydrate utilization

- Fasted training is an option, but not required for fat loss or fat adaptation

- People have options and don't have to fret over having to do something a certain way

- Energy for exercise is derived from the nucleus, mitochondria, and cytoplasm.

- Macronutrients and glycogen are both used as fuel sources.

- Phosphocreatine and muscle glycogen are stored in the cytoplasm.

- Fat and carbohydrates must be transferred into the mitochondria to be metabolized.

- Glycolysis breaks down carbohydrates into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA.

- Hydrogen is released during ATP hydrolysis and can be used to form lactate.

- Lactate can be used as fuel when oxygen is available.

- Endurance is about energy production and waste management.

- Carbohydrates are metabolized by splitting the 6 carbon glucose chain into two 3 carbon molecules, then moving them into the mitochondria and running them through the Krebs cycle.

- The anaerobic and aerobic systems are interdependent.

- Lactate is a fuel that is strongly preferred by the body

- It was originally associated with fatigue due to higher concentrations found in hunted stags

- Lactate is not the core driver of fatigue, but is instead a buffer for the negative consequences of ATP hydrolysis

- Lactate can be used as a fuel source for the liver, heart, and other muscles

- High concentrations of lactate can cause pain and require managing of waste products

- Phosphocreatine is used for 0-20 seconds of maximal exertion

- Carbohydrate metabolism is used for 2 minutes

- Glycogen storage in the muscle increases with training

- Pyruvate is split into two carbon molecules and shipped to the mitochondria

- Oxygen is used to combine with the free floating carbon to make CO2

- Hydrogens are stored on pyruvate to form lactate

- Lactate is an acid buffer and can be used for gluconeogenesis

- Lactate is a valuable fuel source for exercise, cognition, and other things.

- Doing a 20 minute bout of exercise prior to taking an exam can increase exam scores.

- Exercise can improve memory retention and scores on exams.

- Wendy Suzuki is a pioneer in this space and has data to support her work.

- Doing a longer bout of exercise can have additional benefits.

- Endurance exercise is about managing waste production and bringing oxygen into the system to use the carbons in the mitochondria

- Carbohydrate is the primary fuel source for endurance exercise

- Strategies to maximize endurance include: increasing muscle glycogen, building better acid buffering systems, and using supplementation and breathing techniques

- To improve performance, identify the limiting factor and create a strategy to defeat it

- Protein is generally at best going to represent 10% of energy output

- Fat is pulled from the entire body when lost

- Fat is metabolized through a process called beta-oxidation

- Any type of exercise can be effective for fat loss

- Relationship between exercise intensity/type and hunger stimulus is unknown

- Phosphocreatine is a fast-burning fuel source, like a match.

- Carbohydrate is a slower-burning fuel source, like a newspaper.

- Fat is an unlimited fuel source, but too slow to be used for performance.

- Protein is not a fuel source, but can be used to make glucose.

- Protein is a valuable commodity and should not be used as a fuel source.

- Low-carb/zero-carb diets can lead to slower performance in anaerobic-based sports

- High-fat, low-carb diets are effective for weight management and energy stabilization

- Restricting something (e.g. sodium or macronutrients) is necessary to lose weight

- Personal preferences should be taken into account when crafting a nutrition strategy

- Muscular endurance is the sixth adaptation on the list of nine adaptations and is generally in a local muscle.

- Muscular endurance is not a cardiovascular or systemic issue and is usually 5-50 repetitions.

- Muscular endurance is trained by getting close to failure and increasing capillarization.

- Capillarization is increased by training for muscular endurance and getting close to failure.

- The exact signal for increased capillarization is unknown, but is speculated to be a combination of acidity, carbon dioxide, and nitric oxide.

- Exercise choice should be high precision and target the muscle group and movement pattern you want

- Exercise order doesn't matter much, but larger muscle groups should be done first

- Training load should be at or slightly above what you want to move

- Training frequency can be 3-4 times a week

- Progression should be adding a rep or two per week

- Don't always go to failure with strength or high-intensity intervals

- Anaerobic capacity is the total amount of work you can do for seconds to a few minutes at extremely high levels of fatigue.

- Fat and carbohydrates are not the limiting factors in anaerobic capacity.

- Oxygen transportation and acid buildup become problems when doing anaerobic capacity exercises for a long time.

- Specificity is key when training for anaerobic capacity.

- High, moderate, and low intensity training should all be included in anaerobic capacity training.

- Zone 1 is easy walking, Zone 2 is a pace or intensity of exercise that one can maintain a conversation while barely pushing any harder.

- The gear system is a way to think about the zones and get a sense of what zone one is in. Gear 1 is nasal breathing at a set cadence, Gear 2 is nasal breathing at whatever rate is needed, Gear 3 is nasal to mouth breathing, and Gear 4 is mouth to mouth breathing.

- CO2 tolerance test is a test of how reactive one is to elevations in CO2. It is okay for CO2 to rise, but one should not go into a panic due to a small increase in CO2.

- Anaerobic capacity can be trained through exercises such as sprinting, cycling, swimming, and running uphill.

- Exercise choice should be something the individual is comfortable with and should avoid heavy eccentric loads.

- Perform exercises at close to 100% output.

- Number of sets/repeats should be tailored to the individual and their goals.

- High intensity interval training should be done at close to 100% output.

- For maximum heart rate, one day a week minimum, two days better.

- For 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off protocol, four rounds minimum, three days a week.

- For 20 second burst, higher rest than work ratio recommended.

- For one-minute all-out sprint, one to three rounds recommended, two or three times a week.

- After one-minute all-out sprint, three minutes of nasal-only breathing recommended before returning to work.

- Protocol to try: cover as much distance as possible in two minutes, then rest for two minutes

- Round two: cover the same distance as round one, regardless of time taken

- Round three: cover the same time domain as round two, and try to cover a greater distance

- Rest two minutes between rounds

- Protocol created by Kenny Kane

- Progress by increasing work done by 5% each week or by adding a round each week

- Encourage people to do 20 second bursts to challenge phosphocreatine

- 30-50 second bursts with 1-1 work/rest ratio to challenge acid buffering

- 60 second bursts with 2-1 work/rest ratio to maintain high quality

- 70 second bursts with 1-3 work/rest ratio to work on bringing in nutrients

- Set up a weekly schedule with 20 second bursts, 60 second bursts, and one all-out effort

- Maximum aerobic capacity is related to anaerobic capacity, but focuses more on oxygen transportation and waste product clearance

- Exercise choice should be something that can be done continuously without stopping

- Frequency should be 1-2 times per week

- Volume should be 5-15 minutes at maximum intensity

- 40% of time should be spent on lower intensity support work

- Combining both anaerobic and aerobic capacity can be done by doing one of each per week

- Long-duration endurance exercise should be something that can be done without getting injured

- Novelty can be added to the exercise by creating a circuit of different movements

- An alternative to running is to use machines for 10 minutes each

- Low load and light reps can be used to keep heart rate at a steady state

- Specific adaptation is related to the fat-burning system

- Steady-state endurance is important for most training goals.

- 20-30 minutes of steady-state exercise once a week is recommended.

- Diaphragmatic and intercostal fatigue can occur with long-duration cardio.

- Training the musculature around the lungs is important.

- Technical breakdown is the marker of failure.

- Pay attention to posture and efficiency when training.

- Incorporate 60 to 120 minutes of long-duration work per week, such as a weight-vested hike or a backpack with some items in it

- Aim for a fast enough clip that you are breathing harder than if you were just shuffling along

- Can be done in one long afternoon, two shorter sessions, or blended with other interval stuff

- Can be done before or after strength training, or as its own independent day

- 10 minutes of running or sprinting, 6 minutes of higher intensity, and 30 minutes minimum of longer duration

- Enhances mitochondria, blood flow, oxygenation, and manages fatigue and waste development

- Compatible with strength and hypertrophy training

- 70% of training should be in the moderate intensity zone to build tissue tolerance and motor skill development

- 10% of training should be in the 20 second burst area to maximize fatigue and recovery

- 10% of training should be in the 5-15 minute range to build repeated endurance

- 10% of training should be in the 20 second burst or maximum speed area

- Training should be split into two days for those with a tight schedule

- Training should be split into three days for those with a five day schedule

- Dopamine is strongly related to motivation pathways and its levels need to be controlled.

- Quality sleep and non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) are two science-supported tools to replenish dopamine levels.

- Avoid using Adderall, Ritalin, or other illegal substances to increase dopamine as they are dangerous and can deplete the dopamine reservoir.

- Get your sleep right and do NSDR once a day for 10-30 minutes to replenish dopamine levels.

- Be aware of things that stimulate dopamine and don't expect to do them every day without feeling depleted.

- Figure out how many hours of focused work you can do consistently and update that number every 4-5 years.

- People's number one goal is related to health, but it is difficult to achieve

- A physical therapist introduced the speaker to an elite running team

- The team used a narrowed focus of attention, like a spotlight on a target, to improve their performance

- The speaker tested this strategy on everyday people and found that it improved their performance by 27% and hurt 17% less

- Dozens of studies have been done since to explore the effects of narrowing visual attention

- Olympic athletes tend to be sprinters, who use a narrowed focus of attention

- Long distance runners use a more expansive focus of attention at first, but switch to a narrowed focus about halfway through the race

- Narrowed focus of attention is used strategically and increases in use as the race progresses

- Narrowed focus of attention is particularly effective when pushing for the last push to the finish line

- Narrowed focus of attention engages brainstem circuitry for alertness and changes the optics of the eye

- People report focusing on a specific point or the entire horizon of a goal

- Encouraging people to imagine a circle of light shining on a target

- Joan Benoit Samuelson talks about focusing on a circle of attention

- Visual aperture effects, goal lines, and dopamine are linked to motivation

- Common strategies to motivate oneself include vision boards, dream boards, and Post-it notes

- Writing down goals and creating a visual manifestation of them can be effective for identifying what you want

- However, this strategy may not be effective for helping you to meet the goal

- Physiological changes, such as decreased systolic blood pressure, can indicate that the strategy is not working

- Dopamine reward from immediate feedback can prevent people from completing their goals

- Goal setting should include practical day-to-day plans in addition to long-term plans.

- Gabrielle Oettingen identified a third stage of goal setting: thinking about the obstacles that stand in the way of success.

- Thinking about potential obstacles in advance can help increase motivation and prepare for potential failure.

- Michael Phelps and his coach incorporated this strategy into his training, which helped him win 8 gold medals in the Beijing Olympics.

- Vision is special because it takes up more real estate in the brain than any other sense

- We prioritize what we see over what we hear, taste, or touch

- We rarely get the experience of having our visual experience second guessed

- Visual illusions challenge us to see something we hadn't seen before

- Setting realistic but inspirational goals can help us reach our goals

- Vision can be used as a tool to help us reach our goals

- Visual perception of space and time are related

- Narrowing visual window can change perception of time

- Perception of space can be impacted by physical state (e.g. fatigue, overweight, etc.)

- Visual illusion of proximity can be induced by providing energy to the body

- Visual illusion of proximity works for everyone, regardless of physical state

- Visual illusion of proximity can be used to motivate exercise

- Caffeine is a stimulant that causes a change in our visual world, including larger pupils.

- Pupil size is also regulated by the brightness of the environment.

- Caffeine can be used to motivate and narrow the visual aperture.

- People can also use psychological tricks to achieve the same effects as caffeine.

- Visual attention can be anchored by outside events.

- Non-physical goals, such as reading, learning music, or a language, can be difficult to track progress on.

- Visualizing progress can be helpful for non-visual goals, such as highlighting individual lines or words on a page.

- The Reporter app can be used to track progress on non-visual goals by randomly asking questions and recording answers.

- Memory can be faulty when assessing progress on goals, so data can be used to get an accurate assessment.

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

The first live event will be hosted in Seattle, Washington on May 17th. The second live event will be hosted in Portland, Oregon on May 18th. Both are part of a lecture series entitled The Brain-Body Contract, during which I will discuss science and science-based tools for mental health, physical health, and performance. I should point out that while some of the material I'll cover will overlap with information covered here on the Huberman Lab podcast and on various social media posts, most of the information I will cover is going to be distinct from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere. So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th, Portland on May 18th. You can access tickets by going to hubermanlab.com slash tour, and I hope to see you there. Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate

- Teaching and researching at Stanford with the goal of bringing zero cost science and science-related tools to the public

- Athletic Greens is a sponsor of the podcast and helps cover basic nutritional needs and has probiotics for microbiome health

- Thesis is a nootropics company that creates targeted nootropics for specific outcomes

- InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from blood and DNA to help reach health goals

- InsideTracker provides clear directives in terms of lifestyle, nutrition, and supplementation to bring values into the best ranges

- There are nine different adaptations you can get from exercise, with fat loss being a by-product

- Skill, speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic power, VO2 max, and long duration endurance are the categories of personal and athletic development

- Progressive overload is necessary to continue to improve, which can come from adding more weights, repetitions, complexity, etc.

- Progressive overload variables can be changed to get different results

- Exercise selection is important but does not determine adaptation

- Intensity refers to percentage of one rep max or max heart rate/VO2 max

- Conversion charts can be used to estimate one rep max without taking it

- Variables that can be manipulated to achieve different outcomes: intensity, volume, rest intervals, and progression

- Soreness should be kept to a low level (3/10)

- Frequency is the last modifiable variable and is important for adaptations

- Increase strength without increasing muscle size possible

- Increase range of motion to enhance strength development and hypertrophy.

- Include one upper body press, one upper body pull, one lower body hinge, and one lower body press in exercise selection.

- Increase intensity to challenge muscle to produce more force.

- Maintain fast twitch muscle fibers for aging.

- Tailor exercise prescription to individual needs.

- Strength training should involve high intensity (85%+ of one rep max) and low repetition range (5 reps or less).

- Warm up with sets of 10, 8, 8, 5 reps at 50%, 60%, 70%, 75% respectively.

- Rest intervals should be 2-4 minutes.

- Supersetting exercises can reduce the length of the training session.

- Training duration should not exceed 75 minutes.

- Hypertrophy type training and anaerobic conditioning will provide the most physiological adaptations.

- Determine training frequency based on personal fitness level.

- Train once every 5-7 days with high intensity to gain 40 pounds of muscle in 12 months

- Training frequency depends on goal (hypertrophy vs. strength)

- Soreness is not a good barometer of exercise quality

- Strength training can be done daily as it is intensity driven

- Early adaptations to exercise are nervous system based

- Strength development requires manipulation of the nervous system, muscle contraction, and connective tissue

- Muscle size and strength have a relationship, but not a one-to-one ratio

- Optimal window for hypertrophy is 48-72 hours

- Volume is the main driver of hypertrophy, with 10-20 working sets per muscle group per week being the minimum threshold

- High-intensity training with one set to absolute failure can be effective for growth

- Interference effects can impact hypertrophy

- Stimulants are not recommended

- Strength training frequency should be at least twice per week per muscle

- For hypertrophy, repetition ranges should be between 5-30 reps per set

- Train to failure, but not extreme failure

- Look for 3 things in your workout: feeling the muscle contract, feeling a pump, and feeling soreness

- Aim for a 1-10 scale of feeling the muscle contract and soreness

- Mix and match repetition ranges for variety

- Strength and power can be achieved with the "three to five concept" of three to five exercises, three to five reps, three to five sets, and three to five minutes rest in between.

- Intensity is the differentiator between strength and power: 85%+ for strength and 40-70% for power.

- Frequency can be as little as three sets of three for three exercises, three times a week, or as high as five sets of five for five exercises, five days a week.

- Intentionality matters for both strength and hypertrophy training

- Quality of work is more important than just checking off the box

- Mind-muscle connection can result in more growth than not

- Flexing in between sets can be beneficial

- Cut 15 minutes out of a workout to get 20 minutes of quality work done

- Looking at a particular muscle can help recruit more fibers for potential hypertrophy

- Muscles that can be recruited easily tend to grow more readily than those that cannot.

- People can learn to engage particular muscle groups more effectively over time for hypertrophy, strength, and injury prevention.

- Proprioceptive feedback is important for muscle activation and stabilization.

- Eccentric overload is a good way to target difficult-to-activate muscles.

- Eccentric-emphasized movements lead to more soreness and require longer recovery than concentric movements.

- Breathing is important for muscle activation and stabilization.

- If you can maintain intramuscular and intra-abdominal pressure while breathing, then you don't need to worry about when you breathe.

- Generally, exhale on the effort and inhale on the lesser effort portion of an exercise.

- For more reps, come up with a breathing strategy such as every third breath or exhale on the third and reset.

- After a workout, do a calming breath such as nasal breathing, box breathing, or triangle breathing for 3-5 minutes.

- This will help with recovery and prevent adrenaline from crashing later.

- Exercise choice should be mostly concentric based, such as cycling, swimming, rowing, and pushing a sled

- Start with activities that involve minimal eccentric load to avoid muscle damage, soreness, and pain

- 150-180 minutes of zone two cardio per week is recommended for most people to maintain cardiovascular health

- Interference effect is real, but likely overblown, and depends on the type of endurance training and energy intake

- AMPK activation is fine, but if activated, it will inhibit mTOR, which is necessary for muscle growth

- Most endurance athletes should include some strength and power component to their training

- Cutting long endurance runs to 30 minutes, 3-4 times a week, can help avoid interference effect

- 150-180 minutes of general physical movement is recommended for overall health

- Once a week, do a workout that gets you to your maximum heart rate (30 seconds or more)

- Benefits include increased stroke volume, cardiac output, resting heart rate, nitric oxide release, endothelial health, capillary, mitochondria, pulmonary exchange, and more

- Training protocol should be based on point of failure

- High interval training can be complimentary to hypertrophy training

- Once a week, do 90 seconds near maximum heart rate (4-8 times) and 2-6 minutes of hard work with equivalent rest in between (1-8 times)

- Muscular endurance is important for joint health

- Fast twitch fibers contract with higher velocity, but are more glycolytic and fatigable

- Slow twitch fibers are smaller, packed with mitochondria, and better at burning fat as fuel

- Each individual muscle has a combination of fast and slow twitch fibers, which differs from muscle to muscle and person to person

- Muscular endurance helps slow twitch muscle fibers and muscles maintain their job and joint integrity

- Injury often occurs when not paying attention, fatigued, or getting in position to initiate a movement

- Exercises do not determine adaptations, application does

- Injury occurs when too much volume, intensity, or complexity is applied, or when stress is put into a part of the system that should not absorb it

- To reduce injury, reduce complexity, volume, and intensity, and train just below the threshold of pain activation

- Half of body weight in ounces should be consumed as fluid each day

- During exercise, body weight divided by 30 in ounces should be consumed every 15-20 minutes

- 500 milligrams of salt should be consumed before and after exercise

- Caffeine intake should be in a normal range to avoid diuretic effects

- Diet quality matters as the fluid content in food can vary

- Sodium intake should be monitored to ensure it is not too high or too low

- Sweat testing can be done to measure sodium levels in sweat

- Personal preference should be taken into account when deciding whether to eat before exercise

- Cold showers are not as effective as cold immersion for strength and hypertrophy training.

- Cold exposure training should be done away from strength and hypertrophy training.

- Cold water immersion can enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and improve endurance adaptations.

- Cold water immersion should be used for recovery rather than adaptation.

- Heat can also be used for recovery.

- Heat exposure can increase growth hormone, vasodilation, and sweating

- Hot baths are a good way to aid in blood flow and metabolic stress

- Benefits of heat exposure after strength hypertrophy and endurance training are plausible, but more research is needed

- Hydration is important when using sauna or hot baths

- Cold exposure can be beneficial, but it should not be used as a substitute for exercise

- Cold exposure can improve HRV scores and reduce fatigue

- Immersion in cool to cold water is better than a cold shower

- Grip strength and carbon dioxide tolerance test are two methods used to gauge recovery of the nervous system and systemic recovery

- Stress intake and recovery capacity should be balanced to achieve the most adaptation

- Performance anchors should be identified and tracked to increase recovery capacity

- Tracking methods include grip strength, HRV, force plate, tap test, blood, urine, subjective and objective measures, and vertical jump

- Carbon dioxide tolerance test involves four deep, slow breaths in through the nose, out through the nose, and then a big inhale as max exhale

- Consistent testing should be done in the morning for best results

- Sodium bicarbonate is a supplement used to regulate pH levels and enhance performance

- Fatigue is often caused by pH issues, not lack of fuel or oxygen

- Energy is produced aerobically (with oxygen) and anaerobically (without)

- Carbohydrates and fat are the two primary sources of energy

- Fat is broken down into glycerol backbone and fatty acids, carbohydrates are stored as glycogen

- Pyruvic acid can grab hydrogen to form lactate when oxygen is not available

- Sodium bicarbonate should be taken 20-60 minutes before exercise in small amounts to avoid gastric distress

- Other effective supplements for health and performance include nutrition, supplementation, and general health supplements

- Sodium bicarbonate and beta alanine are effective and safe supplements for physical health and performance.

- Creatine monohydrate is the "Michael Jordan" of supplements, with a strong safety profile and effects across multiple domains.

- Creatine monohydrate has been studied for its effects on the neurological system and mental health.

- A journal club can be used to discuss and extract agreed upon conclusions from research papers.

- Taking 5 grams of creatine monohydrate per day may have cognitive effects.

- AbsoluteRest is a cutting-edge project that provides solutions to improve sleep quality

- It uses first principle thinking to identify the root cause of sleep issues

- It screens for psychological, physiological, and pathological issues, as well as environmental factors

- Athletic Greens is a supplement that helps meet foundational vitamin, mineral, and probiotic needs.

- Theragun is a handheld percussive device that releases deep muscle tension and can be used for minutes or hours.

- Theragun starts at $199 and comes with a 30 day money back guarantee.

- Workspace optimization is a topic of interest due to the productivity of mentors in cluttered environments.

- Variation exists in how people focus in cluttered environments.

- Variables of workspace optimization include vision, light, noise, music, and noise canceling headphones.

- Checklist of variables to optimize workspace regardless of location.

- Goal is to get into an optimal state to learn, be productive, and move through work bouts in a relaxed and focused way.

- Brain is in a state of high alertness in the morning, whether or not caffeine is consumed

- Brightly lit environment can lend itself to optimal work throughout the day

- Get morning sunlight in eyes within 30-60 minutes of waking

- Overhead lights stimulate melanopsin ganglion cells in eyes, creating a state of alertness

- Stimulate focus and release of neuromodulators like dopamine, norepinephrine, and cortisol

- Use overhead lights, desk lamps, ring lights, or light pads to increase brightness

- Sunlight through an open window is most effective for stimulating wake-up signal

- Dim lights in the afternoon (9-16 hours after waking) to shift from dopamine/norepinephrine to serotonin/other neuromodulators

- Turn off overhead lights and reduce blue light exposure

- Use yellow/red lamps in the later afternoon

- Dim screens in the later afternoon

- For shift workers, students, and those who need to stay up late, limit the amount of bright light in the eyes to only what is necessary to do the work.

- If staying up late, consider flipping on all the lights in the room to stay awake.

- Drinking 32 ounces of water and not going to the bathroom for 90 minutes can increase alertness.

- Modulate the brightness of the environment throughout the day, with brighter lights in the morning and dimmer lights in the afternoon.

- Our visual focus in a given environment is important for alertness and maintaining alertness.

- Our eyes have six muscles that can move them in different directions.

- Looking down below the level of the nose can reduce alertness, while looking straight ahead or up increases alertness.

- This has an evolutionary component and can be used to optimize work environments.

- To maximize focus and alertness, keep the screen at eye level or slightly above.

- Consider wall mounting a monitor, stacking books or boxes, or using pillows to elevate the screen.

- Posture is important for alertness and avoiding "text neck"; standing or seated is ideal.

- If lying down, make sure the screen is elevated and slightly tilted toward you.

- Standing up activates neurons in the brainstem that release norepinephrine and epinephrine.

- Sitting or lying down decreases alertness and increases sleepiness.

- To maximize alertness, the environment should be bright and the screen should be in front of or above the user.

- Over-consumption of fluids can generate alertness, but is not necessarily healthy.

- Taking frequent breaks can help maintain focus.

- It is unreasonable to expect to be able to focus immediately on something, unless you are very stressed or excited.

- Neurochemicals like dopamine and norepinephrine bring about alertness.

- Most people can only maintain focus for about three minutes before switching tasks.

- It takes about six minutes to engage neural circuits and get into a focused state.

- Maximizing workspace and using tools to limit distraction can help shorten the latency to focus.

- Our visual pathways have two major channels: Parvo cellular (high resolution) and Magnocellular (low resolution)

- To optimize workspace, keep visual focus within the region of visual space in front of you

- Vergence eye movements create heightened states of alertness and focus

- Restricting visual window changes the types of information best processed

- Virgin's eye movements require energy and can fatigue the eyes

- For every 45 minutes of focused work, take a 5 minute break to relax your eyes.

- Best way to do this is to go outside and look off into the distance.

- Looking at a horizon will trigger a panoramic gaze which is very relaxing to the eyes.

- Do not check your phone during the break.

- If possible, take a 15 minute walk instead of a 5 minute break.

- The cathedral effect is a way to use physical environment to shift brain and nervous system into a mode primed for analytic or abstract/creative thinking.

- High ceilings activate concepts related to abstraction, whereas low ceilings prime confinement related concepts and promote detailed thinking.

- The size of people's spontaneous movements scales down in smaller environments.

- The height of the ceiling of the visual environment has a profound effect on the types of cognitive processes that can be engaged.

- To leverage the cathedral effect, do creative work in high ceiling environments and detailed analytic work in lower ceiling environments.

- People vary in their tolerance for background noise

- White noise, pink noise, and brown noise can all have an effect on cognition

- Avoid loud, ongoing noise like air conditioners and heaters as it can cause mental fatigue and impair cognitive performance

- White noise, especially loud white noise, can cause disruption in auditory and language processing

- Listening to white noise, pink noise, or brown noise can increase alertness and facilitate cognition, but should be done in moderation

- Isochronic tones are tones of a common frequency, such as a beep and then a pause and then a beep of the same frequency.

- Monaural beats are repetitive, almost percussive-like beats delivered to just one ear.

- Binaural beats are beats delivered to the two ears, with one pattern of kind of percussive beat to one ear and a different pattern, or at least a pattern that's out of phase, delivered to the other ear.

- Binaural beats create a particular pattern of intraoral time differences that then cascades up to the rest of the brain and puts the forebrain and other areas of the brain into a particular rhythm.

- Studies of binaural beats suggest they can be useful for people to enhance their brain function for particular kinds of tasks.

- 40 Hertz binaural beats appear to bring about improved cognitive functioning, memory, reaction times, and verbal recall.

- Colzatto et al. 2017 found faster reaction times in participants that listened to binaural beats of 40 Hertz.

- Binaural beats of 40 Hertz or higher appear to be most beneficial for learning, memory, and recall.

- Lower frequency binaural beats (7 Hertz) have been found to decrease immediate recall memory.

- 15 Hertz binaural beats have been found to increase response accuracy on a spatial verbal memory task.

- 40 Hertz binaural beats should be listened to for 30 minutes before a work bout for optimal results.

- 40 Hertz binaural beats pattern affects striatal dopamine release

- Increased dopamine release is associated with increased motivation and focus

- Blink rate is an indirect measure of dopamine release

- Dopamine and epinephrine work together to put us on a path of movement towards a goal

- 40 Hertz binaural beats can enhance focus, reduce reaction times, and improve learning and memory

- Interruptions can be deadly to focus and productivity

- Strategies to limit interruptions include: recording a message, having a sign on the door, not orienting body towards the person, saying no, and working in a dark closet

- Digital strategies to limit interruptions include: using Freedom, turning off Wi-Fi, turning off phone, and putting phone on airplane mode

- Taking breaks from the phone throughout the day can be beneficial

- Studies have shown that sitting for long periods of time can have negative effects on health and productivity.

- Combining sitting and standing at a desk throughout the day or alternating between desks is the best practice.

- It is easy to convert a sit desk into a stand desk.

- Standing for half of the work day can improve health metrics and productivity.

- It can take a few days to adapt to standing for long periods of time.

- There is no significant difference between cycling or treadmill workstations on any cognitive or typing outcomes.

- Active workstations (treadmilling or cycling) improve attention and cognitive control scores compared to seated workstations.

- Verbal memory scores get worse during active sessions.

- Active workstations may reduce anxiety and recruit neuromodulators associated with the reticular activating system, leading to improved focus and attention.

- Bright lights should be used for maximum alertness

- Place focus directly in front of you with a restricted visual window

- Stand for at least half of the workday

- Avoid white, pink, or brown noise for extended periods of time

- Consider using 40 Hertz binaural beats for 30 minutes prior to work

- Get into a low ceiling environment for analytic work and a high ceiling environment for creative work

- Consider using supplements to increase dopamine and focusing on a visual target for 30-60 seconds prior to work

- Habits can be reflexive actions or more elaborate behaviors

- Habits can be beneficial or detrimental to our health and life goals

- Neuroscience and psychology have studied habit formation and breaking

- 2021 is a good time to think about New Year's resolutions

- Today's podcast will discuss the biology of habit formation and breaking

- Practical tools will be provided to help form and break habits

- InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from blood and DNA to help reach health goals

- Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows tailored to unique sleep needs; offers up to $200 off all mattress orders and two free pillows

- Habits are learned consciously or unconsciously and make up 70% of our waking behavior.

- Learning is the process of neuroplasticity, which involves changes in the connections between neurons.

- Neuroplasticity is the process of forming new neural circuits and pathways to support the development of habits.

- Habits can be divided into immediate goal-based habits and identity-based habits.

- Immediate goal-based habits are designed to bring a specific outcome each time they are done.

- Identity-based habits are linked to a larger goal and are associated with motivation and reward.

- Dopamine release can predict whether or not a habit will be formed quickly.

- It takes 18-254 days to form a habit, depending on the individual

- The study looked at a health-related behavior, taking a walk after dinner

- Limbic friction is the strain required to overcome anxiousness or tiredness

- Limbic friction is a useful metric to measure the difficulty of forming a habit

- Limbic friction can also be used to measure the difficulty of breaking a habit

- Identity-based habits vs. goal-based habits

- Different habits take different periods of time to adopt depending on the person and the habit

- Linchpin habits are certain habits that make other habits easier to execute and are always enjoyable

- Ask yourself what habits you perform on a daily basis

- We are wired to be habitual and tend to do things in the same way unless we intervene.

- Habit strength is measured by context dependence and the amount of limbic friction required to perform the habit.

- Context dependence is whether the habit is performed the same way in different environments.

- Limbic friction is the conscious override of the state required to engage in the habit.

- The goal of any habit is to be deeply embedded in the nervous system.

- Automaticity is the ultimate goal of habit formation, as it requires less mental and physical effort.

- Popular psychology literature offers ways to reach automaticity.

- Structuring habits at particular times of day or in a particular way can be beneficial.

- Applying the scientific literature of how the nervous system learns and engages in neuroplasticity can help with habit formation, maintenance, and breaking habits.

- Psychology of Habit by Wood and Runger is an excellent review article published in Annual Review of Psychology

- Episodic memory is a recall of a particular set of events, whereas procedural memory is holding in mind the specific sequence of things that need to happen in order for a particular outcome to occur

- Visualization exercise of the sequence of steps required to execute a habit can shift people towards a higher likelihood of performing that habit regularly

- This process involves the hippocampus, neocortex, and other areas of the brain and nervous system that engage in procedural memory

- This tool can reduce limbic friction and increase the likelihood of performing a habit

- Hebbian learning is when neurons fire together and strengthen their connections

- NMDA receptors are important for Hebbian learning and make neurons more responsive to input

- To adopt and maintain a habit, take the time to step through the procedure of the habit

- To return to a habit, use the procedural memory exercise to increase the likelihood of returning to the habit

- Task bracketing is a tool rooted in neural circuits that can help acquire and stick to new habits.

- Task bracketing involves the dorsolateral striatum, an area of the basal ganglia, which becomes active at the beginning and end of a habit.

- Task bracketing helps make habits context-dependent and more likely to occur even if feeling distracted or overwhelmed.

- Task bracketing can be strengthened by visualizing the sequence of events required to engage in the behavior.

- Task bracketing is like warming up the body to exercise, priming the body and brain to execute a habit.

- Schedules are important for habit formation, but not the specific time of day.

- Habits are formed based on the state of the brain and body, such as level of activation, focus, fatigue, and energy.

- Neural mechanisms of task bracketing can be leveraged to increase the likelihood of performing a particular habit.

- Divide the 24 hour day into three phases: Phase 1 (0-8 hours after waking), Phase 2 (9-14/15 hours after waking), and Phase 3 (16-24 hours after waking).

- Phase 1 has a particular neurochemical signature, with elevated norepinephrine, dopamine, cortisol, and body temperature.

- Suggested activities for Phase 1 include: viewing sunlight/bright artificial light, physical exercise, cold exposure, caffeine ingestion, fasting, and consuming foods rich in tyrosine.

- Leverage neural systems to make it more likely to engage and maintain a particular habit in Phase 1.

- Phase two of the day is 9-14 hours after waking and is characterized by a decrease in dopamine, norepinephrine, and cortisol and an increase in serotonin

- During this phase, it is beneficial to limit bright light exposure, practice NSDR activities (meditation, yoga nidra, self-hypnosis, etc.), and use ashwagandha to reduce cortisol

- This phase is ideal for forming habits that require less conscious override of limbic friction, such as journaling, music practice, language learning, etc.

- For those who prefer to exercise in this phase, it is important to practice NSDR activities afterwards to promote neuroplasticity and muscle recovery

- Neuroplasticity and rewiring of neural circuits occurs during deep sleep, which runs from about 16 to 24 hours after waking

- To support deep sleep, environment should be kept dark and temperature low

- Eating should be done at least two hours before bed, and no caffeine should be ingested in the evening

- If waking up in the middle of the night, use minimal light to navigate surroundings

- Use supplements, Reverie app, NSDR, and Yoganidra to help fall back asleep

- Moving a habit around somewhat randomly can be beneficial to you.

- The hippocampus is where memories are formed, not stored.

- The strength of a habit is dictated by how much limbic friction and context dependence there is.

- Once a habit has become reflexive, you can play with the time of day it is performed.

- If you can do a habit in any context, you have officially formed a habit.

- Reward prediction error is associated with the molecule dopamine and is a lens through which to think about whether or not we should reward ourselves for performing a given habit.

- If we expect a reward and the reward comes, a particular behavior that was associated with generating that reward is more likely to occur again.

- If a reward arrives that's unexpected, the amount of dopamine reward that we get is actually much greater than in any other conditions.

- If we expect a reward and the reward doesn't come, the pattern of dopamine release will follow a particular contour.

- Reward prediction error governs virtually all aspects of effort and all aspects of learning, as dopamine is released in the brain and body, causing a state change.

- Think about the events that precede and follow a habit to positively associate dopamine reward with the entire sequence

- Use the procedural memory visualization exercise to walk through the steps of the habit

- Positively anticipate the period headed into the habit and the positive benefits afterwards

- Apply reward prediction error to the entire sequence of events involved in the habit

- Dopamine is a molecule of motivation and drive, not just reward

- Research different systems for habit formation to find the best one for you

- 21-day system for habit formation, rooted in biology and psychology of habit formation

- List 6 things to do each day for 21 days, but only expect to do 4-5

- Chunk 21 days into two-day bins to reset

- After 21 days, assess how deeply habits have been rewired

- No punishment for missing a day, no habit slip compensation

- After 21 days, don't add new habits, just assess how well existing habits have been embedded

- Breaking habits can be challenging due to the speed at which they occur.

- Stress reduction, good sleep, quality nutrition, and positive routines can help break habits.

- Long-term depression is a cellular and molecular explanation for how something goes from unlearned to learned to reflexive.

- To break habits, one must create a reward for not performing the activity or a punishment for forming the activity.

- A meta-analysis by Heather Fritz in the Journal of Occupation, Participation, and Health provides insight into breaking habits.

- Notifications and reminders are effective in the short-term, but not in the long-term.

- Electric shock, monetary penalties, and other forms of punishment are effective in breaking habits.

- The key to breaking habits is to take action immediately after the bad habit is executed.

- Bringing conscious awareness to the period immediately after a bad habit is a powerful way to insert a different behavior.

- This creates a temporal mismatch between the bad habit and the good habit, allowing for easier intervention.

- Rewarding a bad habit with a good habit can help to dismantle the neural circuits associated with the bad habit.

- Positive behaviors should be easy to execute and adaptive for the individual.

- Tacking on additional behaviors to bad habits can help to break them.

- Breaking bad habits is difficult

- Dopamine is a neuromodulator that is responsible for motivation, drive, craving, time perception, and movement.

- It is not responsible for pleasure.

- It is released in two forms: tonic (baseline) and phasic (peaks).

- After experiencing something pleasurable, dopamine levels drop below baseline.

- Dopamine is depleted in diseases like Parkinson's and Lewy body dementia, leading to shaky movements, difficulty speaking, and drops in motivation and mood.

- When treated, people with these diseases can recover some fluidity of movement and improved mood.

- There are two main neural circuits in the brain that dopamine uses to exert its effects: the mesocortico-limbic pathway and the nigrostriatal pathway.

- The mesocortico-limbic pathway is involved in motivation, drive, and craving and includes structures such as the nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex.

- The nigrostriatal pathway is mainly for movement and emerges from an area in the brain called the substantia nigra.

- Dopamine is released in different ways depending on the context.

- Neurons communicate with one another by making each other electrically active or less active through the use of vesicles filled with a chemical

- Dopamine can influence neural circuits at both a local and broad scale

- Taking drugs or supplements that increase dopamine can make it harder to sustain dopamine release over long periods of time

- The height of the peak relative to the baseline is important in determining how pleasurable an experience is

- There are two main neural circuits, one for movement and one for motivation and craving, that are influenced by dopamine

- Dopamine works through G-protein coupled receptors, which are slower than ionotropic conduction

- Dopamine can be released in small vesicles or in larger volumes

- Dopamine can have short-term or long-term effects, including influencing gene expression

- Dopamine can have two pathways: one for movement and one for motivation and craving

- Dopamine can operate on two spatial scales: synaptically or volumetrically

- Dopamine does not work on its own; it co-releases glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, which stimulates neurons and increases alertness and desire to pursue things outside oneself.

- Dopamine is responsible for movement, motivation, and drive.

- Low dopamine levels lead to lethargy and lack of motivation, while high dopamine levels lead to excitement and motivation.

- Dopamine is a universal currency in mammals, tracking pleasure, success, and quality of life.

- Dopamine levels affect motivation and drive

- Dopamine levels depend on recent experience and baseline levels

- Repeatedly engaging in something enjoyable can raise the threshold for enjoyment

- Nature Reviews Neuroscience has a detailed review on dopamine transmission

- Two anecdotes are shared to illustrate the importance of dopamine

- In the 1980s, an outbreak of Parkinsonian symptoms occurred in a young population due to illicit laboratories creating MPTP instead of MPPP.

- MPTP kills the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and mesocortico-limbic pathway, leading to paralysis and an inability to move.

- Thorazine is an antipsychotic drug used to block dopamine receptors, leading to an overwhelming sense of depression.

- L-DOPA can be used to restore dopamine levels.

- Dopamine is a powerful molecule that shapes our perception of life and how we feel, and should be carefully leveraged.

- All individuals have different baseline levels of dopamine, which can be genetic

- Dopamine is not the only chemical driver of energy; epinephrine (adrenaline) is also released from the adrenal glands and locus coeruleus

- Dopamine and epinephrine are closely related, with epinephrine being converted from dopamine

- Dopamine colors the subjective experience of an activity to make it more pleasurable

- Dopamine and epinephrine work together to make individuals seek out certain things

- Chocolate increases dopamine 1.5 times above baseline

- Sex increases dopamine two times above baseline

- Nicotine increases dopamine two and a half times above baseline

- Cocaine increases dopamine two and a half times above baseline

- Amphetamine increases dopamine 10 times above baseline

- Exercise increases dopamine two times above baseline, depending on how much the person enjoys it

- Certain activities and chemicals have a universal effect on dopamine levels

- Caffeine increases dopamine to a modest extent

- Regular ingestion of caffeine increases upregulation of certain dopamine receptors

- Different compounds and behaviors can synergize to give bigger dopamine increases

- Layering together multiple substances and activities that lead to big dopamine increases can create issues with motivation and energy

- Occasional pre-workout or cup of coffee before working out is ok, but too often can lead to decreased dopamine release and motivation

- Dopamine is the universal currency of foraging and seeking, and is the driver for us to seek things.

- Dopamine increases when a reward is found, but then drops below the baseline level.

- The extent to which dopamine drops below baseline is proportional to how high the peak was.

- Everyone experiences a drop in dopamine after a peak, even if they are not addicted.

- There is a way to work with this to stay motivated and keep dopamine at a healthy level.

- Dr. Anna Lembke is the head of the Addiction Dual Diagnosis Clinic at Stanford and has written the book Dopamine Nation

- The Molecule of More is another book about dopamine and its relationship to behavior

- Dr. Lembke talks about the pleasure-pain balance, where pleasure is derived from indulging in something but is followed by a subtle pain

- Dopamine is released from synaptic vesicles and the pleasure-pain balance is related to the amount of dopamine that is ready to be released

- When dopamine levels increase, the baseline drops due to lack of dopamine

- Dopamine is released when engaging in activities or substances that bring pleasure, but too much can lead to addiction and a drop in baseline dopamine.

- People can become addicted to activities such as video games, leading to a narrowing of the things that bring pleasure and eventually a drop in dopamine release.

- People who engage in activities such as drinking on the weekends or eating foods that evoke dopamine release can also experience a drop in baseline dopamine.

- To replenish the releasable pool of dopamine, people should limit interactions with dopamine-evoking behaviors or substances.

- Cold turkey or tapering can be used to limit interactions and help replenish dopamine levels.

- Dopamine is released through activities such as eating chocolate, drinking coffee, and engaging in consensual sex.

- Intermittent reward schedules are used to keep people engaged in activities such as gambling and texting.

- To maintain motivation and pleasure in activities, it is important to not expect or chase high levels of dopamine release every time.

- To achieve this, one can use an intermittent reinforcement schedule, such as flipping a coin before engaging in activities.

- Smartphones can be used as a tool to help with this.

- People commonly use digital technology to layer in dopamine while engaging in other activities.

- This can lead to disruptions in dopamine levels and an increase in depression and lack of motivation.

- Personal example of layering in too many sources of dopamine and losing interest in activities.

- Removing multiple sources of dopamine release can help to increase pleasure in activities.

- Understanding the biological mechanisms behind dopamine can lead to a deep satisfaction.

- Caffeine can be beneficial for dopamine system

- Energy drinks and pre-workouts contain dopamine precursors and can deplete dopamine over time

- Stimulants like Adderall, Ritalin, Armodafinil, and Modafinil can reduce satisfaction and joy from activities

- Intermittent spiking of dopamine is the best way to go to maintain motivation, focus, and drive

- Caffeine can increase the density and efficacy of dopamine receptors.

- Yerba mate contains caffeine, antioxidants, and GLP-1, which is favorable for blood sugar levels.

- Yerba mate has been shown to be neuroprotective for dopaminergic neurons.

- Consuming caffeine in the form of yerba mate can increase dopamine and provide neuroprotective properties.

- Caffeine can be beneficial in some contexts, but can be dangerous in others, particularly when combined with MDMA (ecstasy).

- MDMA is being investigated for its potential to treat trauma and depression, but is still illegal in the US.

- Debate exists as to whether MDMA is neurotoxic, but caffeine has been shown to increase its toxicity.

- Caffeine increases the density and efficacy of dopamine receptors, which can lead to more toxicity when combined with MDMA.

- Amphetamine and cocaine are two substances that greatly increase dopamine.

- A 2003 study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that amphetamine and cocaine can limit the ability of later experience to promote structural plasticity in the neocortex and nucleus accumbens.

- Neuroplasticity is the basis of learning and memory and essentially remodeling of our neural circuitry in positive ways of all kinds.

- Ingesting amphetamine and cocaine can cause a drop in baseline dopamine and limit plasticity and learning for a long period of time.

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

In a previous episode on ADHD, I talked about the widespread use of drugs like Adderall, Ritalin, modafinil, and armodafinil, all of which lead to very large increases in dopamine. And for people with ADHD can really improve their symptoms. But of course, there's a lot of non-prescription, non-clinical use of those compounds as well. And it stands to reason that the use of those substances to increase dopamine could very well provide the same sort of blockade of neuroplasticity that cocaine and amphetamine do. Because when you look at the amount of dopamine increase that's triggered by those compounds, it's really comparable. So again, a cautionary note against spiking one's dopamine too much on a regular basis, unless there's a valid clinical need for doing that.

- Dopamine feels great and there is a place for activities that increase dopamine in a safe way.

- Cold water exposure is one such activity that can increase dopamine levels, as well as norepinephrine.

- Cold water exposure has been popularized by Wim Hof and dates back to the 1920s.

- Safety parameters should be established when engaging in cold water exposure.

- Cold water exposure can increase dopamine levels up to 2.5 times above baseline.

- Cold water exposure can also increase feelings of calm and focus.

- Frequency of cold water exposure can vary from daily to every once in a while.

- Rewards can make hard work more challenging and make us less likely to lean into hard work in the future.

- Intrinsic vs. extrinsic reinforcement: rewards can make us associate less pleasure with the activity itself.

- Dopamine controls our perception of time and can extend the time bin over which we analyze or perceive an experience.

- Growth mindset involves learning to access rewards from effort and doing.

- Accessing dopamine from effort itself is the most powerful aspect of dopamine and our biology.

- To access dopamine from effort, don't spike dopamine prior to or after engaging in effort.

- Intermittent fasting is a popular example of attaching dopamine to effort and strain, rather than a process or reward that naturally evokes dopamine release.

- When we fast, dopamine levels go up when we finally eat, due to the deprivation state increasing the way dopaminergic circuits work.

- Fasting can evoke more dopamine release than eating a smaller portion of food.

- Telling yourself that certain behaviors are good for you can reinforce the extent to which they are good for you at a chemical level.

- Dopamine is not only attached to primitive behaviors, but also to behaviors we decide are good for us.


was a study that was published last year in the journal Neuron, cell press journal, excellent journal that showed that hearing something that reinforces one's prior beliefs actually can evoke dopamine release. So the dopamine pathway is so vulnerable to subjective interpretation that it actually makes it such that when we see something or hear something that validates a belief that we already have that itself can increase dopamine release. Along the lines of how dopamine and dopamine schedules and our perception of things can shape the way that we experience things as pleasurable or not. There are beautiful studies,

- Ingesting something that is sweeter or more savory than what you previously ate can make the original food taste less good.

- Blocking the shift in dopamine can prevent this shift in perception.

- Dopamine levels should be kept in a dynamic range that is different for everyone.

- Highly palatable foods can make whole foods taste less good.

- Not consuming highly palatable foods for a short period of time can make whole foods taste delicious again.

- Dopamine establishes value based on what you experienced in the days and minutes before.

- Accessibility and intensity of pornography can negatively shape real world romantic and sexual interactions.

- Neurobiological mechanisms of dopamine release explain why people can become addicted to pornography.

- Regular indulgence in pornography can lead to challenges in real world romantic interactions.

- Ethical and moral discussions should be had to decide individual age-appropriate use of pornography.

- Welbutrin (buprenorphine) increases dopamine and norepinephrine, and is an alternative treatment for depression for those who suffer from serotonin-related side effects.

- It can blunt appetite and increase motivation and craving, but can also increase anxiety due to the stimulation of dopamine and norepinephrine.

- Dosage must be determined by a clinician, and it can be used to treat depression and to help people quit smoking.

- Mucunipurines is a velvety bean whose contents are L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine, and is sold over the counter.

- It can reduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease and the hormone prolactin.

- It can increase sperm concentration, quality, and motility.

- It can cause a transient increase in dopamine, but can also cause a crash or reduction in baseline dopamine.

- L-tyrosine is an alternative for those seeking to increase dopamine without taking prescription pharmaceutical compounds.

- L-tyrosine is an amino acid precursor to L-DOPA, and is sold over the counter in the US to increase energy, alertness, and focus.

- A 1983 study showed that L-tyrosine increases dopamine levels within 45 minutes, but the effect is short-lasting.

- Tryptophan ingestion does not increase dopamine, but increases serotonin instead.

- Taking macunipurines and L-tyrosine can lead to an increase in dopamine, but can also lead to a crash afterwards.

- Taking L-tyrosine occasionally is recommended, as relying on exogenous substances to activate dopamine circuits can lead to a drop in dopamine levels.

- Melatonin can help one get to sleep, but not stay asleep.

- Dr. Matt Walker, sleep expert from University of California, Berkeley, generally states that the use of melatonin, except for treatment of jet lag, is generally not a good idea.

- A study published in 2001 found a statistically significant decrease in dopamine 60 minutes after melatonin administration.

- Viewing bright lights between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. has been shown to reduce levels of dopamine for several days after that light exposure.

- Avoid exogenous melatonin if possible to maintain healthy levels of dopamine.

- PEA (phenylethylamine) increases dopamine levels and is found in various foods, including chocolate

- PEA can be taken as a focus and work aid, typically in doses of 500 milligrams

- Alpha-GPC can also be taken in doses of 300 milligrams

- PEA leads to a sharp, but transient increase in dopamine that lasts 30-45 minutes

- PEA is more regulated and even than L-tyrosine and mucunipurines

- Huperzine A is a compound gaining popularity as a nootropic for increasing dopamine.

- It increases acetylcholine transmission and leads to increases in dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.

- It is sold over the counter in the US and is being used to tap into the dopaminergic and cholinergic circuits.

- It is a milder alternative to drugs like Adderall, Ritalin, Modafinil, and R-modafinil.

- It is recommended to research the compound before taking it.

- Oxytocin and social connection directly stimulate the dopamine pathway

- Oxytocin was previously thought to be related to the serotonergic pathway

- A 2017 paper showed that oxytocin, social connection, and pair bonding trigger dopamine release

- Social connections can evoke oxytocin release, even without skin contact

- Pursue quality, healthy social interactions to stimulate dopamine pathways

- Covered material related to dopamine pathways and circuitries

- Discussed indirect mechanisms that can influence dopamine, such as maca root and gut microbiome

- Cold water exposure leads to huge and sustained increases in dopamine

- Dopamine pathways are under our control

- Taking a walk each morning is a powerful way to reduce anxiety by reducing activity in the amygdala.

- This is due to the phenomenon of forward ambulation and optic flow.

- Studies have shown that lateral eye movements reduce activity in the fear/threat/anxiety center of the brain.

- Walking outdoors is important to ensure alertness and focus.

- This helps to prepare for a bout of work and lean into the day.

- Get outdoors for 10-30 minutes, ideally with no sunglasses, to stimulate the melanopsin neurons in the eyes.

- Sunlight exposure is key to mental and physical health, and should be done first thing in the morning.

- Cortisol is released in the morning and is important for wakefulness and a healthy immune system.

- Avoid staring directly at the sun or any light that is too bright.

- Combine sunlight exposure with a walk for optimal alertness and calm.

- Sunlight exposure is not necessary to set your circadian rhythms.

- Bright LED lights are available at a fraction of the cost of a morning light simulator.

- Bright lights should be viewed when you want to be alert, and exposure to light should be eliminated when you want to sleep.

- Blue light is optimal for stimulating neurons in the eye and should not be shielded from during the day.

- Blue blockers should only be worn in the late evening and at night.

- Dimming the lights and setting them lower in the environment is a better remedy for sleep than blue blockers.

- Hydration is essential for mental performance

- Drink at least 16-32 ounces of water per day

- Add a small amount of sea salt to the water to help with ionic flow

- Drink water before beginning any work

- Dehydration can occur even if the day is not hot

- Avoid drinking cold water first thing in the morning

- Delay caffeine intake 90 minutes to 2 hours after waking

- Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, preventing sleepiness

- Delaying caffeine intake prevents afternoon crash

- Fasting until 11am or 12pm helps to achieve a focused yet alert state

- Fasting is used to create a heightened state of alertness and calm brain state

- Caffeine sources include yerba mate and guayusa tea, avoiding coffee

- Drinking water and athletic greens is compatible with fasting

- Fasting increases levels of epinephrine/adrenaline, which helps with focus and memory

- Different people have different opinions on what breaks a fast

- Fasting is highly individual and depends on factors such as insulin sensitivity, recent eating history, blood sugar history, and glycogen stores.

- Eating a large amount of almond butter would not break a fast for someone with low insulin levels.

- Eating a tablespoon of sugar would break a fast, but for how long depends on other factors.

- For most days, fasting consists of drinking water, caffeine, and athletic greens.

- Yerba mate and guayusa teas increase release of GLP-1, a hormone related to glucagon

- GLP-1 has positive properties, such as increasing lipolysis and mobilization of body fat stores

- Temperature minimum is an important piece of data that dictates when a 90 minute work bout should start and end.

- Temperature minimum is usually 5-6 hours before the average wake up time.

- Temperature minimum defines the trough of the 24 hour temperature cycle, and the rise in temperature triggers the release of cortisol.

- To optimize the 90 minute work bout, it should be placed during the steepest slope of the temperature rise.

- People who feel alert first thing in the morning should leverage that time, but those who struggle to find focus should use their physiology to support their efforts.

- Data from the 1990s supports the idea that physical movement can support brain health and function.

- Exercise should be approximately 60 minutes, with a 3:2 ratio of strength and hypertrophy work to endurance work.

- 80% of resistance training should be below failure, and 20% should be to failure.

- 80% of endurance work should be below the burn threshold, and 20% should be above.

- Exercise should be done 5 days a week for optimal health benefits.

- Training fasted has immediate and long-term benefits

- Ingesting electrolytes (sodium, magnesium, potassium) can quell hunger and help neurons to function properly

- Caffeine sources (guayusa, mate, espresso, coffee) can increase motivation and fat metabolism

- Alpha-GPC (300mg) can improve cognitive performance

- Eat first meal around noon

- Volume of food is important to maintain alertness and focus

- Protein, healthy fats, and low-ish carbohydrates or no carbohydrates for lunch to achieve heightened states of alertness

- Omega-3 fatty acids support healthy mood and can act as an antidepressant

- Ingesting at least 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA is as effective as prescription antidepressants

- Selenium is important for proper thyroid production and thyroid function

- Structuring day with periods of 12 hours or more of fasting each 24-hour cycle is beneficial for brain and body health

- Hormones have broad effects on the body and brain and are manufactured from cholesterol

- Eating butter can help ensure sufficient cholesterol levels for hormones

- Exercise, fasting, and morning sunlight can support testosterone and estrogen levels

- Taking 400mg of Tongat Ali per day and Fidogia agrestis can help increase levels of free testosterone and estrogen

- Taking a brief walk after eating can accelerate metabolism and improve nutrient utilization

- Getting outside light exposure is beneficial for metabolism, nutrient utilization, and all organs and tissues

- Non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) is an umbrella term for protocols that support better brain and body function, such as meditation, yoga nidra, and hypnosis.

- Hypnosis is unique in that it is very directed and can be used to guide the brain toward a particular outcome or change.

- Reveri.com is a free hypnosis app with multiple protocols backed by scientific studies.

- Hypnosis has been shown to activate areas of the brain associated with executive function, deep relaxation, focus, and self-awareness.

- Hydration is also important for brain function.

- It is important to drink water to maintain bodily functions.

- Caffeine should be consumed 90 minutes to 2 hours after waking.

- Naps should be 90 minutes or less, and 20-minute naps are fine.

- People should decide if napping interferes with their sleep.

- 90-minute cycles are important for sleep health.

- Viewing bright light or even not so bright light between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. can disrupt learning and memory, the immune system, and mood.

- To offset this disruption, view light in the afternoon for 20-30 minutes.

- This lowers the sensitivity of the retina in the late evening hours, allowing you to buffer yourself against the negative effects of bright light later at night.

- Doing this helps to keep the melatonin rhythm appropriate, allowing for easier sleep.

- Simple protocols like this can help to optimize brain and body health, performance, and sleep.

- Dinner should be comprised of foods that support rest and deep sleep, such as starchy carbohydrates

- Refined sugars should be avoided as they disrupt neurons in the gut and can cause cravings

- Protein should also be included in the evening meal

- Eating carbohydrates can increase serotonin levels, which helps with the transition to sleep

- Supplementing with serotonin can cause disruptions in sleep architecture

- Low-carb diets can be beneficial for alertness and focus, but carbohydrates should be eaten for inducing rest and relaxation

- Leverage the drop in temperature necessary to fall and stay asleep by using hot baths, hot showers, or saunas.

- Keep the room dark and cool to facilitate cooling off during the night.

- Consider taking magnesium threonate or biglycinate, apigenin, and theanine 30-60 minutes before sleep to aid the transition to sleep.

- Magnesium threonate and biglycinate may have neuroprotective effects.

- Magnesium threonate and magnesium biglycinate can support neuron health and neuron longevity.

- Waking up in the middle of the night can be caused by pushing yourself to stay awake too late or anxiety.

- To counteract this, one can go to bed earlier or get more bright light in the evening.

- Non-sleep deep rest protocols such as yoga nidra or sleep hypnosis can help one fall back asleep.

- It is important to do the hardest or most important task of the day early in the day and to take weekends off.

- Take one day off per week to rest and explore what you want to do

- Get morning sunlight and try to get sleep on a regular basis

- Try to wake up and go to sleep at the same time every day

- Aim for one or two 90-minute work blocks per day

- Adapt and modify the schedule to best suit your work

- To maintain or increase muscle strength and size, it is important to do at least 5 sets of resistance training per muscle per week.

- Regular resistance training is important for long-term health and to avoid resembling a folded over envelope or a melted candle.

- Resistance training is beneficial for systemic physiology and overall health, including brain health.

- Details on sets, reps, and when to do cardiovascular training are discussed in the previous episode.

- Endurance is the ability to engage in continuous bouts of exercise or effort of any kind

- Endurance training has a carryover to mental performance

- Cardiovascular exercise and endurance exercise are vital for tapping into and enhancing various aspects of our biology

- Effort, whether mental or physical, requires a bit of science and protocols

- ATP is required for any activity that requires energy

- Different fuel sources can be converted into ATP, such as carbohydrates, fatty acids, and glucose

- Phosphocreatine is used for short, intense bouts of effort

- Glucose and glycogen from the liver can also be used

- Lipids and ketones can be extracted from body fat for energy production
of taking these fuels and converting them into energy, most of the time you need oxygen. You need air basically in your system. Now it's not actual air. You need oxygen molecules in your system. It comes in through your mouth and your nose, goes to your lungs and distributes via the bloodstream. Oxygen is not a fuel, but like a fire that has no oxygen, you can't actually burn the logs. But when you blow a lot of oxygen onto a fire, basically onto logs with a flame there, then basically it will take fire. It will burn, okay? Oxygen allows you to burn fuel. So today we are going to ask the critical questions. What allows us to perform? What allows us to continue effort for long periods of time? And that effort could be a run. It could be a swim. It could be studying.

- Endurance is related to willpower, which is related to neurons in the brain.

- The central governor decides whether or not we should continue or quit.

- The limiting factor on performance is what prevents us from enduring.

- Motivation and fuel allocation are key to understanding endurance.

- Specific training protocols can help carry over bodily systems and brain functions.

- Five main categories of things that allow us to engage in effort are neurons, nerves, muscle, blood, and things in our blood, our heart, and our lungs.

- Consulted with Dr. Andy Galpin, a full professor who does work on muscle biopsy and works with athletes, for this episode.

- Dr. Andy Galpin is a true intellectual of muscle physiology and performance.

- Nerve, muscle, blood, heart, and lungs are the five categories focused on in this episode.

- Experiment discussed in the episode involves neurons and how they work.

- Quitting is a mental thing, not a physical thing

- An experiment showed that a class of neurons in the brainstem, called the locus coeruleus, release epinephrine which acts as an alertness signal

- Epinephrine levels are low when we are relaxed and high when we are engaged in effort

- An experiment showed that when subjects were tricked into thinking their effort was futile, the glia cells shut off the release of epinephrine

- Our ability to persist is neural and is mediated by events between our two ears

or it's 90% mental, 10% physical, you know, that whole discussion about how much is mental, how much is physical is absolutely silly. It just proves that there's no knowledge of the underlying biology behind that statement. It's neither mental nor physical. Everything is physical. Everything is neurons. Your thinking is the responsibility of chemicals and electrical signals in your head. So it's not 90% mental, 10% physical. It's not 50-50. It's not 70-30. It's 100% nervous system. It's neurons, okay? So when people say mental or physical, understand it's 100% neural. And I'd love for the, how much of it is mental and how much is physical to just disappear. That argument means nothing and it's not actionable.

- Nerves need glucose and electrolytes to fire

- Sodium and potassium are essential for the action potential

- ATP and pH are also necessary for nerve firing

- Muscle engages and generates energy using the phosphocreatine system

- High intensity effort is fueled by phosphocreatine and glycogen stored in the muscle

- Contracting a muscle requires burning carbohydrate to generate energy

- Temperature and pH are important factors in physical performance

- Cooling the body can help increase work capacity and endurance

- Pyruvate kinase pathway is temperature dependent

- Blood glucose, fatty acids, and oxygen are fuel sources for physical and mental effort

- Heart and lungs are important for distributing oxygen and fuel sources

- Liver can provide additional carbohydrates for work

- Different types of endurance can be achieved by manipulating blood, heart, muscles, and neurons

- Protocols and tools can be used to build different types of endurance

- Adaptations to Endurance and Strength Training is a review article from Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Medicine

- It can be downloaded as a PDF with no paywall

- It covers signaling cascades, genetic changes, and PGC-1-alpha, P53, and PH20

- It is a primary resource for the content of this episode

- It is recommended for those interested in detailed science

- Endurance is important for the functioning of the body and mind and has longevity benefits.

- Everyone should maintain muscle and engage in regular endurance exercise.

- There are four kinds of endurance: muscular, aerobic, anaerobic, and neuromuscular.

- Each type of endurance has different protocols and fuel sources.

- Muscular endurance is the ability for muscles to perform work over time

- Examples of muscular endurance include picking up a stone 50-100 times and pushups

- Muscular endurance is useful for physical pursuits such as golf, tennis, dancing, and posture

- Muscular endurance is different from cardiovascular endurance

- Muscular endurance can be trained by doing 12-100 repetitions of an exercise

- Examples of exercises to build muscular endurance include pushups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and running

- Muscular endurance training protocol should include 3-5 sets of 12-100 repetitions with 30-180 seconds of rest

- Push-ups, planks, wall sits, and pull-ups are all good exercises for muscular endurance

- Eccentric loading should be avoided as it can cause soreness

- Isometric holds are good for building postural strength and endurance

- Compound exercises are best for muscular endurance training

- Muscular endurance is built by doing 3-5 sets of repetitions to failure

- Muscular endurance is not the same as power and strength training

- Muscular endurance relies on neural energy and the ability of mitochondria to use oxygen to generate energy

- Olympic lifts are not recommended for this type of training due to the risk of injury

- Eccentric portion of the exercise should be light and relatively fast

- Long duration endurance is any activity lasting 12 minutes or longer, such as marathons, long runs, swims, or bike rides.

- This type of work builds on fuel utilization in the muscles and activity of neurons in the brain.

- It is done at less than 100% of your maximum oxygen uptake and is one set of 12 minutes or longer.

- Long duration effort builds the capacity to repeat the performance while being more efficient and burning less fuel.

- It increases mitochondrial density and ATP production for a given bout of effort.

- Long duration endurance is about building capillary beds and mitochondria in muscles.

- Capillary beds are tiny streams between arteries and veins that bring oxygen to muscles.

- Long duration effort (12+ minutes) increases the number of capillaries and mitochondria.

- This allows muscles to use more energy and increases endurance.

- Training with long duration effort once or twice a week can make running a marathon easier.

- High intensity interval training (HIIT) has two types: anaerobic and aerobic endurance

- Anaerobic endurance does not require oxygen

- Aerobic endurance is also considered HIIT

- HIIT can be used to build up specific energy systems in the brain and body

- HIIT can be used to improve cognitive work, strength, speed, hypertrophy, and running marathons

- Anaerobic endurance is 3-12 sets of repetitions performed at whatever speed allows for good, safe form.

- Work-to-rest ratio can range from 3:1 to 1:5.

- Quality of movement is important, so longer rest periods may be necessary.

- Anaerobic endurance exercise can be done 2-3 times a week, adding 1-2 sets each week.

- Anaerobic endurance helps to prevent failure due to fatigue.

- High-intensity interval training (HIIT) involves pushing your heart rate up to more than 100% of your VO2 max.

- HIIT triggers an adaptation in the mitochondria's ability to use oxygen and increases the capillary beds.

- HIIT trains the neurons to access more energy and convert it into ATP.

- HIIT has carryover effects for other types of exercise, such as competitive and team sports.

- HIIT is different from maximum power and speed protocols.

- High-intensity training (HIT) has two forms: anaerobic and aerobic

- Aerobic conditioning involves 3-12 sets with a 3:1 or 1:5 ratio of work to rest

- A powerful tool for building aerobic conditioning is a 1:1 ratio (e.g. run a mile, rest for an equivalent amount of time, repeat)

- HIT should be done 2-3 times a week, with 4-6 hours of rest between workouts

- HIT builds nerve-muscle firing, ATP and mitochondrial function, blood oxygen delivery, heart oxygen delivery, and lung capacity

- Training can improve oxygenation and energy utilization of the brain and heart.

- High intensity aerobic and anaerobic conditioning can cause an eccentric loading of the heart muscle, increasing stroke volume.

- This increased stroke volume delivers more fuel to muscles and brain, improving cognitive functioning.

- Exercise increases vasculature in the brain, supporting memory, respiration, focus, and effort.

- Strength and hypertrophy training can have positive effects on brain function

- High-intensity and long-duration exercise has been shown to have positive effects on brain function

- High-intensity exercise increases oxygenation and stroke volume of the heart, which improves brain function

- Exercise can also improve performance adaptations

- Exercise can be compatible with resistance training

- Strength training with heavy weights (3 reps, rest 5 minutes) is more effective than lighter weights (5-12 reps)

- Allow 4-6 or 24 hours between workouts for concurrent training

- Carbon dioxide tolerance test (4 breaths in and out, followed by a slow controlled exhale) can be used to assess recovery

- Most people need 1-2 full rest days per week

- Combinations of different types of training can be used

- We breathe to bring oxygen into our system and get rid of carbon dioxide in order to utilize fuel and for our brain and body to work.

- Nasal breathing is better as it scrubs the air of bacteria and viruses and is more efficient.

- Mouth breathing is usually used for strong exhales and high intensity training.

- Power Speed Endurance has a gear system to help conceptualize breathing.

- Bruce Lee had remarkable intercostal muscles that allowed him to lift the rib cage and diaphragm

- Warming up the intercostals and nerve pathways before endurance work can allow for deeper breathing and more oxygen delivery to the muscles

- Diaphragmatic breathing involves expanding the stomach and chest when inhaling

- Deep breathing for 3 minutes can help deliver more oxygen to the system.

- Warming up the breathing muscles can help muscles and neurons function better.

- Deep breathing can be done while walking or biking.

- Can use a combination of nasal and mouth breathing.

- Can help generate adrenaline if done intensely.

- Side stitch during endurance work is usually a referenced pain of the phrenic nerve that innervates the liver

- Can be relieved by doing a double inhale, exhale and breathing deeply

- Warming up the intercostals and diaphragm is beneficial

- Intercostals and diaphragm should collaborate to fill the lungs

- Deep inhaling can deliver more oxygen to the system

- When we hit the wall during long runs or bouts of effort, it can be due to psychological, motivational, or fuel-based factors.

- Increasing speed can shift muscles and nerves to utilize a different fuel source.

- Elite athletes rely on carb depletion and loading, as well as exogenous ketones, to access multiple fuel sources.

- Hydration is an important factor in endurance type work.

- We need water and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium) to function properly

- We can lose 1-5 pounds of water per hour of exercise, depending on intensity and weather

- Once we lose 1-4% of our body weight in water, we experience a 20-30% reduction in work capacity

- Urine can give an indication of hydration, but it requires urinating into a small volume

- The Galpin equation can help calculate how much water is needed based on intensity, body size, etc.

- The Galpin equation is a formula to calculate how many ounces of fluid to drink every 15 minutes of exercise (body weight in pounds divided by 30).

- Gastric emptying (ability to move water and electrolytes out of the gut) is hindered when working out at more than 70% of VO2 max.

- Capacity to consume fluids during intense exercise can be trained.

- Hydration is key for muscular and brain performance.

- Sip small amounts of fluid initially and gradually increase to bigger gulps.

- Inflammation is necessary for stimulating adaptations, but should not be around for too long.

- Ice baths and cold showers can improve mitochondrial density and respiration after endurance training.

- Waiting at least 6-24 hours between workouts is recommended, and taking at least one full day of rest each week is beneficial.

- Sleep is important for recovery and should be maximized.

- Individual variation in training frequency should be taken into account.

- Sleep is important for physical performance and should be addressed in the first four episodes of the podcast.

- Parasympathetic down regulation after training can accelerate recovery and enable you to do more work.

- This involves taking five to twenty minutes to do slow, pure nasal, long exhale devoted breathing or lying down and zoning out.

- This helps to quiet down the nervous system and epinephrine release after training.

- Doing this for five minutes should be manageable and can lead to better performance and feeling better.

- Pacing and having a visual pacer is not allowed in many competitions, as it does not allow for legitimate record-holding times.

- Visual system has the capacity to switch between panoramic vision and vergence eye movement.

- Vergence eye movement activates neural circuits in the thalamus and brainstem, which can trigger the alertness system.

- Focusing on a landmark during endurance activities can make it easier to generate more work.

- Alternating between focusing on a milestone and dilating the visual window can help to be more efficient.

- Good runners and cyclists can create a mental pacer in their mind's eye.

- Running is a battle with oneself and a highly competitive sport

- Steve Prefontaine was known for sprinting the entire 5,000 meter race

- Having a visual target can help access higher levels of speed and output

- Visual targets can bring about epinephrine and neural firing

- Willpower and heart are spiritual aspects of running and effort

- Three different levels of protocols for endurance, strength, and hypertrophy work have been provided as a free resource.

- These protocols are based on major publications and research on concurrent training.

- Variations in the protocols may be necessary depending on individual lifestyle and fitness level.

- Supplements were not discussed in this episode.

- Stimulants like caffeine can improve endurance work and power output

- Magnesium malate can reduce delayed onset muscle soreness

- Beet juice and related compounds can increase nitric oxide and vasodilation

- Beta-alanine can give a feeling of itchy, creepy crawlies under the skin

- Endurance is not just physical, but also mental

- Different forms of endurance include muscular, long duration, and high intensity

- Huberman Lab Podcast discusses science and science-based tools for everyday life

- Focusing on physical performance, particularly skill learning

- Discussing how to learn skills more quickly, including motor skills and musical skills

- Going deep into the science of skill learning and discussing specific protocols

- Touching on mental visualization and its role in skill learning

- Sharing information and simple takeaways

- Cooling the palms in particular ways and at particular times can allow athletes or recreational exercisers to do more work and feel better doing it.

- Cooling the palms is a separate protocol from heating up the body with exercise or using a sauna for heat increases, which is geared toward growth hormone release.

- Caffeine can either help or hinder performance depending on whether or not the user is caffeine adapted.

- If the user is accustomed to caffeine, ingesting it before training will not impact body temperature and blood flow in ways that will hinder performance.

- If the user is not a regular caffeine user, it is not likely to be a performance enhancing tool.

- Side stitch or side cramp is not a cramp, but is due to collateralization of the phrenic nerve

- Referenced pain is when one nerve branch affects other nerves

- Side stitch is caused by contractions of the diaphragm due to breathing while exercising

- Relief can be achieved by doing a double inhale, long exhale two or three times

- Doing this during exercise can also help with heart rate variability

- There are two types of skills: open loop and closed loop

- Open loop skills involve immediate feedback, such as throwing darts at a dart board

- Closed loop skills involve continuous feedback, such as running and adjusting stride

- Ask if a skill is open loop or closed loop before attempting to learn it

- Skill learning involves three components: sensory perception, movements, and proprioception

- Sensory perception involves perceiving what is happening around you, such as the trajectory of your arm or the way your partner is moving

- Movements involve the movements of your limbs and body

- Proprioception is a sixth sense of knowing where your limbs are in relation to your body

- When learning a skill, more focus is placed on proprioception than ordinarily

- Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) are located in the spinal cord and generate repetitive movements.

- Experiments in the 60s, 70s, and 80s showed that animals and humans without a cerebral cortex can still engage in repetitive movements.

- CPGs control already learned behavior, such as walking, running, swimming, and cycling.

- CPGs also control complex movements, such as a golf swing.

- Put the ball on the tee and swing to show knowledge of golf

- Central pattern generators handle a lot of the golfing process

- Upper motor neurons control deliberate action and are engaged when learning

- Lower motor neurons also involved in golfing process

- Visualization can be used to accelerate skill learning

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

Lower motor neurons are the ones in our spinal cord that send little wires out to our muscles, which actually cause the firing of those muscle fibers, okay? So the way to think about this is you've got upper motor neurons, which talk to CPGs and to lower motor neurons. So it's really simple. And now you know most everything there is to know about the neural pathways controlling movement, at least for sake of this discussion.

- When learning something, decide what to focus on: auditory, visual, or proprioceptive

- Decide whether to focus on movements of partner or position of feet

- Decide whether to focus on position and posture of body

- Open loop or closed loop is the first question to ask

- Neurology will take care of the rest

- Hollywood has perpetuated the myth that instant skill acquisition is possible.

- The 10,000 hours rule is often used in self-help literature, but it does not match the scientific literature.

- Learning is not about hours, but about repetitions.

- Time and repetitions are related, but experiments have shown this.

- An experiment was conducted with 50,000 subjects to learn a computer program

- Subjects were given feedback in two different ways: "did not work, please try again" or "you lost five points, please continue"

- 68% of the subjects who received the "did not work, please try again" feedback were successful, compared to 52% of the subjects who received the "you lost five points, please continue" feedback

- This experiment contradicts the popular belief that people will work harder to avoid losing something than to gain something

- The experiment supports the idea that more repetitions of a skill can lead to faster learning

- Tube test is an experiment done in mice and rats to measure competitive behavior

- It involves two animals competing for a tube, with the winner being the one that pushes the other out

- The winner has a higher than chance probability of winning again

- A particular area of the frontal cortex is involved in this behavior

- Stimulating this brain area leads to the animal winning every time

- The key to learning a skill is to perform as many repetitions per unit time as possible

- Errors are important as they tell you what to focus on

- Performing the maximum number of repetitions per training session is advantageous for skill learning.

- Errors cue the nervous system to error correction and open the door for neuroplasticity.

- A 2021 paper from Norman et al. found that post-error recruitment of frontal sensory cortical projections promotes attention.

- Errors cue the brain areas that anchor attention and activate neuromodulators that allow for plasticity.

- Dopamine is involved in learning and is released when something is performed correctly.

- To learn motor skills, it is important to have a big spike in dopamine when performing a motor pattern correctly.

- Errors should be made and repeated in order to get to the correct performance.

- Taking pharmacology to increase dopamine levels can be counter-productive as it reduces the signal to noise ratio.

- It is important to pay attention to the correct location of the ball, rather than the action taken.

- The nervous system will take care of the correct action provided enough repetitions are completed.

- Increasing dopamine levels prior to learning is not beneficial and may hinder the plasticity process.

- The framing effect is important for learning, as it cues the brain to what is important.

- Designate a block of time to perform repetitions and aim to do the maximum number of repetitions safely.

- Making errors is key to open up the possibility of plasticity.

- Coaches play an important role in helping learners make errors.

- Training sessions should include a period of repetition and error recognition

- A well-trained coach can help identify errors

- Errors are necessary to cue attentional systems and open the door for plasticity

- Learning sessions should involve getting as many repetitions as possible and paying attention to errors

- Successful performance of a movement should be rewarded with neurochemical rewards

- After a skill learning session, the brain replays the motor sequence corresponding to the correct pattern of movement, but it plays that sequence backward.

- Sitting quietly with the eyes closed for one to five to 10 minutes allows the brain to replay the sequence in a way that appears important for the more rapid consolidation of the motor sequence of the pattern and to accelerated learning.

- Sleep and quality sleep of the appropriate duration is important for learning of all kinds, including skill learning.

- Mental rehearsal should be done both before and after a training session.

- There is a review paper titled "Neuroplasticity Subserving Motor Skill Learning" by Dayan and Cohen (2011) which covers this topic in more detail.

- Errors cue attention and open the opportunity for plasticity in skill learning.

- As skill increases, certainty increases.

- Virtuosity invites uncertainty back into the practice to express full range of abilities.

- Post-learning idle time is important for deeper learning.

- Subsequent sessions are where gains of previous session are expressed.

- Performance is likely to improve with subsequent training sessions.

- Attention can be directed to particular elements of the movement to accelerate learning.

- It does not matter what is paid attention to, as long as it is related to the motor behavior.

- Claudia Lappe's study showed that learning is accelerated when the same thing is paid attention to throughout the session.

- Learning to play the piano is about generating motor commands, not paying attention to the sound.

- Skill learning can be parameterized by focusing on the motor sequence or the sounds.

- Building a protocol across early sessions to make many errors and let the reward process govern plasticity

- Maximize sleep to gain skill level and focus attention on particular features of the movement

- Break down learning process into component parts and master core motor movements session to session

- Focus attention on different features from trial to trial (e.g. ball landing, speed, grip, stance)

- Attack connections between upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons, and central pattern generators one at a time

- Ultra slow movements can be beneficial for enhancing the rate of skill learning, but should be done after some degree of proficiency has been gained.

- Proprioceptive feedback is not accurate with slow movements, and errors are not generated.

- Super slow movements can be beneficial once success rates reach 25-30%.

- Super slow movements are not applicable to all activities, such as throwing a dart.

- Metronoming is a practice that involves generating repetitions and can be used by athletes and musicians.

- Metronomes can be used to set the cadence of repetitions and can be found in the form of apps, devices, and musical metronomes.

- Metronoming can increase the number of repetitions, errors, and successes and can accelerate the plasticity and acquisition of skills.

- Metronomes are a powerful tool for speed work.

- Metronomes are important for generating more efficient strokes or steps in sports like sprinting, swimming, and running.

- Increasing the number of repetitions per unit time can help train the central pattern generators to operate at a higher speed.

- Speed walking is difficult to do without breaking into a run.

- Different central pattern generators are engaged when an animal moves slowly and then breaks into a jog or sprint.

- Metronomes can help bring the activity of central pattern generators into their upper range and extend their range.

- Skill learning involves focusing attention on both external and internal elements.

- The cerebellum is a mini brain located in the back of the brain and is involved in movement and non-movement associated functions.

- It takes in information from the senses, particularly the eyes, and pays attention to the movement of the eyes in space.

- It integrates information about pitch, yaw, and roll of the eyes and body movements.

- It also has a map of the body surface and movements and timing.

- A lot of learning of motor sequences and skill learning involving timing occurs in the cerebellum.

- Range of motion and flexibility is not determined by muscle length or elasticity

- Moving through space and operating throughout the day can increase range of motion

- Visual attention has an aperture that can be broadened to relax the nervous system

- Moving eyes from side to side can increase range of motion by 5-15 degrees

- Acceleration and moving through space can open up windows for plasticity

- Visualization and mental rehearsal can also increase range of motion

- Visualization involves some work and some people find it easier than others

- Studies have shown that visualization can lead to increases in strength and skill acquisition

- Visualization engages the activity of upper motor neurons, which generate the command for movement

- Visualization is not as effective as physical training, but can supplement or support it

- Visualization can be used to create newer and better protocols

- People performed visualization training for 15 minutes a day, 5 days a week for 12 weeks

- Visualization training involves closing eyes and imagining going through a particular skill or movement

- Visualization training can be used to accelerate performance, strength increases, etc.

- Visualization training can be used in addition to physical training to increase rates of learning and consolidation of learning

- It is difficult to study the effects of visualization training due to difficulty in controlling for physical training

- Visualization does not work as well as actual physical training and practice.

- Visualization can still be effective, but it does not create the same environment as physical engagement.

- Proprioceptive feedback is important for communicating to the nervous system that something is actually happening.

- Visualization can lead to increases of 35% or 13.5%, but physical training can lead to increases of 53%.

- PTSD should be treated with the utmost seriousness and should not be confused with the replay of a traumatic event.

- Herholtz and Zatore published a review in the journal Neuron about how musical training can impact physical skill learning

- Cadence training with tones or auditory feedback can help with instrumental music training and physical skill learning

- The review is available online for free

- Motivation is key to accelerate skill learning

- No pill that will allow you to do fewer repetitions and extract more learning

- Consider conditions that can create to generate more repetitions per unit time (e.g. hydration, caffeine)

- Alpha-GPC (over the counter) can improve physical performance and cognitive function

- Caffeine can motivate and enhance rate of skill learning

- Cognitive learning should be followed by a spike in epinephrine/adrenaline levels

- Physical learning should be preceded by caffeine or alpha-GPC

- Allow for idle time after training for motor sequences to replay

- Focus on repetitions and errors

- Use metronoming to increase repetitions per unit time

- Use visualization to augment practice when weather is not ideal

- We discussed motor pathways and central pattern generators to help optimize learning of motor skills.

- Ultradian cycles are 90-minute cycles that are optimal for learning and attention in the waking state.

- Physical practices may not need to be 90 minutes long, depending on the activity.

- Maximum focus and repetitions in a short amount of time is beneficial for skill learning.

- Skill improvement may not be linear, but will be vast with the right practice.

- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast, discussing science and science-based tools for everyday life

- Discussion focuses on how to change the nervous system for the better through motor commands and aspects of movement and balance

- Protocols and tools discussed are based on scientific literature and tailored to individual needs and goals

- The brain and nervous system control behavior through two categories of neurons: lower motor neurons and upper motor neurons.

- Lower motor neurons live in the spinal cord and send electrical signals to the muscles.

- Upper motor neurons reside in the motor cortex and send signals for deliberate action.

- Central pattern generators in the brainstem control repetitive patterns of movement.

- Plasticity can be leveraged to access changes to emotional experience, belief systems, and memory.

- Exercise is beneficial for cardiovascular function, strength, and bone density, but does not open plasticity.

- Behavior can change the brain, but only if it is different enough from existing behaviors.

- To open plasticity, certain things must be done in addition to exercise.

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

And the answer is yes, provided that behavior is different enough from the sorts of behaviors that you already know how to perform. And I should have added the word well, because you can't obviously perform a behavior that you don't know how to perform because you don't know how to do it yet. But there's a key element to accessing neuroplasticity that frankly, I don't see out there in the general discussion about neuroplasticity. In the general discussion about neuroplasticity and about learning, I hear all these gimmicks about using different ways

- Memorizing lots of information is not the goal; being selective about what you remember is.

- Adaptive changes are key to accessing neuroplasticity.

- Traumatic brain injury and dementia are topics for a future episode.

- Behaviors that engage neuroplasticity can help you learn or unlearn specific things.

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

that we're really talking about learning a bunch of motor movements. You may be an athlete, you might not be an athlete. You might want to learn how to dance, you might not. You might want to learn how to dance and get better at remembering and learning languages, for instance, or at unlearning some difficult emotional experience, meaning you want to remove the emotional load from a particular memory of an experience. What we're talking about today is using behavior as a gate to enter states of mind and body that allow you to access plasticity. So let's talk about the different kinds of plasticity that are available to us because those will point directly towards the type of protocols that we should engage in to change ourselves for the better,

- Representational plasticity is the internal representation of the outside world

- We have maps of auditory, visual, and motor space

- Proprioceptive feedback helps us know where our limbs are

- Plasticity is created by mismatches or errors in how we perform things

- Neuroplasticity is created by sending signals

- Neuroplasticity is not achieved through flow, but through the release of certain neurochemicals (acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine).

- Making errors is the signal to the brain that something is wrong and needs to be changed.

- Making errors over and over again is the route to shaping the nervous system to perform better.

- Last episode discussed the principles of neuroplasticity and focus.

- This episode focuses on dopamine and making errors as a signal to the brain to pay attention and change.

- The brain is incredibly plastic from birth until age 25.

- Passive experience shapes the brain due to chemicals and neuron arrangement.

- Plasticity begins to taper off after age 25 and different mechanisms are needed to engage plasticity as an adult.

- When young, the brain is very plastic but has less control over experience.

- When older, generally, more control over experience is available.

- Get a broad education in a variety of topics

- Find something that captures your passion and put extra effort into it

- Emotional development is important

- Tap into plasticity mechanisms to mark nerve cells for change

- Natural conditions allow for change; supplements, drugs, machines are not necessary

- Our nervous system is able to link visual, auditory, and motor spaces by aligning them in perfect register.

- This alignment takes place in the superior colliculus.

- Experiments have revealed that these maps are plastic and can be shifted.

- Eric Knudsen's experiment showed that wearing prism glasses can shift the visual field.

- Young individuals can quickly adjust their motor behavior to reach to the correct location when their visual world is distorted by prism glasses or inverted glasses.

- These representational maps can move, shift, rotate, and even flip themselves.

- Plasticity in adults can be achieved by understanding the signal for plasticity, which is not just having prism glasses on.

- The Knudsen Lab and other labs have looked into how to achieve plasticity as adults that mimics the plasticity of juveniles.

- Errors signal to the nervous system that something is not working and cause the release of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.

- Frustration is an emotional state that the brain does not understand, but the release of epinephrine, acetylcholine, and dopamine can help the brain to focus on the error margin and make changes.

- Young brains are naturally able to make these changes, but older brains may need more practice and patience.

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

it tends to be pretty slow except for in two conditions. So let me just pause and just say this. If you are uncomfortable making errors and you get frustrated easily, if you leverage that frustration toward drilling deeper into the endeavor, you are setting yourself up for a terrific set of plasticity mechanisms to engage. But if you take that frustration and you walk away from the endeavor, you are essentially setting up plasticity to rewire you according to what happens afterwards, which is generally feeling pretty miserable. So now you can kind of start to appreciate why it is that continuing to drill into a process to the point of frustration, but then staying with that process for a little bit longer, and I'll define exactly what I mean by a little bit, is the most important thing for adult learning

- Juveniles can make massive shifts in their map representations quickly

- Adults tend to learn slowly and may not achieve full map shifts

- Incremental learning is essential for adults to make small errors

- Smaller bouts of focused learning are necessary for adults to learn

- Adults can engage in a huge amount of plasticity with incremental learning

- Motor learning involves making errors in order to access plasticity

- Aim for the point of frustration when learning a motor behavior

- Focus on the desired behavior rather than specific details

- Plasticity is a state of the brain and nervous system

- Shorter bouts of intense learning are more efficient for adults than longer bouts

- Errors are necessary to signal plasticity to the brain

- Incremental learning is about signaling to the nervous system which component needs to change.

- When shooting free throws, there are many different errors that can occur.

- The nervous system will figure out how far off the motor commands are from the desired behavior.

- Short learning bouts (7-30 minutes) are essential for learning an instrument as an adult.

- Plasticity in the nervous system can be achieved all at once as an adult.

- The Knudsen Lab revealed that plasticity in adults can be as dramatic and robust as in young people, provided there is a serious incentive for the plasticity to occur.

- The importance of something determines how fast plasticity will arrive.

- Just going through the motions is not sufficient to get the nervous system to change.

- The need to change must be crucial enough for the nervous system to change quickly and to a large degree.

- This has relevance for people battling addiction, as it has a biological component.

- People can struggle to change their behavior, but it is possible with the right internal belief and desire.

- Knudsen's studies show that incremental learning can create a high degree of plasticity in adults.

- Contingency (i.e. the need to eat or make an income) can also create plasticity.

- There is an underlying neurochemical system that can be tapped into to create change.

- Specific behaviors can liberate particular categories of chemicals to make the most of incremental learning.

- Ultradian rhythms (90-minute cycles) help break up our 24-hour day and sleep into different cycles.

- Ultradian cycles help us learn best in 90-minute cycles

- Learning involves intense focus and repetition of tasks

- Making errors during a 7-30 minute period can help accelerate plasticity

- Learning can also be accelerated when something bad happens

- Negative experiences are wired into us quickly because our nervous system's main job is to keep us safe.

- Negative experiences deploy high levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine, making us on the lookout for it.

- Positively surprising experiences or being flooded with dopamine can increase neuroplasticity, motivation, etc.

- Dopamine is released when we think we're on the right path toward an external goal.

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

and it tends to give us more motivation toward that goal. I think everyone could stand to enhance the rate of learning

- Combining two modes of plasticity (making errors and focusing on learning) can accelerate plasticity.

- Frustration is a cue for epinephrine to be released.

- Subjectively associating the experience of making errors with something good can create a synergy between dopamine and failure.

- Telling ourselves that failures are good for learning and good for us can accelerate plasticity.

- Dopamine can be released by telling ourselves something is good.

- Dopamine is a highly subjective molecule that is released in response to basic behaviors and activities, as well as what we subjectively believe is good for us.

- Dopamine can be released in response to things like food, sex, warmth, and cool environments.

- The book "The Molecule of More" talks about dopamine not just as a molecule associated with reward, but also motivation and pursuit.

- To maximize learning, make lots of errors and attach dopamine to them, and keep learning bouts relatively short.

- Children learn faster than adults due to their ability to pack more information into their brains and nervous systems.

- Being a child is like being in a performance-enhanced brain milieu due to natural, healthy neurochemicals.

- Advice for young people: learn as much as possible about many things and specialize in something by age 30.

- Find something that excites you and become really good at it

- Identify the times of day when you have the highest mental acuity

- Engage in learning bouts for 7-30 minutes, making errors and seeking frustration

- Find pleasure in the frustration to create an optimal neurochemical milieu for learning

- Brain is in a heightened state to learn and retain information after engaging in a physical activity

- Chemicals released during physical activity can stay in the brain for up to an hour

- Heightened learning state can be used to learn motor patterns, cognitive information, and language information

- Error states can be accessed through physical activity

- These states are not gimmicks, but tap into basic mechanisms of plasticity

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

are balance, meaning the vestibular system, as well as the two sides of what I call limbic friction or autonomic arousal. And if none of that makes sense, I'm going to put a fine point on each one of those and what it is and why it works for opening up neuroplasticity.

- Limbic friction is a term used to describe the feeling of being too alert or too tired

- Stress is not a good word to describe what most people experience as stressful

- To access neuroplasticity, one needs focus, reward, and the ability to make errors

- To calm down, one can use a double inhale-exhale technique or panoramic vision

- To wake up, one can get a good night's sleep, use an NSDR protocol, or use super oxygenation breathing

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

and I want to be more alert? You're going to need to engage in behaviors that bring you to the starting line in order to learn. There are other things that you can do in order to then learn better and faster besides incremental learning, and those center on the vestibular system. And this may come as a surprise to some people, but probably not as a surprise to some of you whose professions or whose recreation involves a lot of motor activity and sort of what we call high dimensional skill activity, not just running or cycling or very linear activities like weightlifting,

- The vestibular system is the hardwired system for balance

- It works through three planes of movement: pitch, yaw, and roll

- The semicircular canals in the inner ear contain little stones that roll back and forth to detect movement

- Errors in vestibular motor sensory experience can lead to neuroplasticity

- Autonomic arousal needs to be at the correct level to start a learning bout

- Limbic friction can cause you to be too tired or too alert

- Disrupting the vestibular motor relationship can release neurochemicals in the brain that make learning easier and more pleasurable

- Flow state is a state of heightened arousal that can help with learning

- Flow is an expression of what you already know how to do, not how you learn

- Engaging the vestibular system and creating errors can create a neurochemical state that makes you good at learning quickly

- Examples of activities that can help reach this state include inversions, yoga, taking corners faster on a bike, and swimming different strokes

- The key parameter is how regularly you perform a particular motor behavior and how novel it is

- Novel behaviors in relation to gravity can create plasticity in the body and brain.

- People who are experienced in a certain activity may not experience the same level of excitement as a beginner.

- To create novelty and plasticity, one must explore the sensory motor vestibular space by being in a new position or slightly unstable.

- Examples of activities that can create novelty include yoga, gymnastics, handstands, and biking.

- It is important to stay safe and not put oneself at risk.

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

So the first gate is to arrive at learning at the appropriate level of autonomic arousal. Clear and focused is best, but don't obsess over being right there. It's okay to be a little anxious or a little bit tired. Then you want to make errors. We talked about that. And this vestibular motor sensory relationship is absolutely key if you want to get heightened or accelerated plasticity. And we talked about another feature, which is setting a contingency. If there's a reason, an important reason for you to actually learn, even if you're making failures, the learning will be accelerated. So there's really four things that you really need to do for plasticity as an adult. And I would say that these also apply to young people. And there's an interesting kind of thought experiment there as well, which is if you look at children,

- As we age, we tend to move in more linear and regular ways, reducing our engagement with neuroplasticity.

- Resistance exercise trains nerve-to-muscle connections as much as muscles themselves.

- Engaging the vestibular system in novel ways can safely increase plasticity.

- Surfing is an example of orienting the body differently according to the gravitational pull.

- High contingency activities can also amplify plasticity.

- Plasticity has limits and cannot be accelerated infinitely

- Brain machine interface technology does not yet exist to download knowledge quickly

- Nootropics can increase focus but should be used with caution

- Behavioral tools and ways of structuring learning bouts can increase plasticity regardless of age

- Incremental learning is powerful

- The vestibular system can open up opportunities for plasticity

- Respect for the yoga community and its practices is acknowledged

- Yoga has many practices with specific names, but no explanation of how they work.

- Science has many mechanisms and publications, but little explanation of tools and practices.

- Goal is to bridge the gap between disciplines, mainly through neuroscience.

- Understanding mechanism allows for flexibility and adaptation to dynamic life circumstances.

- Neuroscience can be powerful in understanding how to access dopamine and adjust limbic friction.

- Athletic Greens also offers a year's supply of liquid vitamin D3K2 and five free travel packs

- Today's podcast will discuss dreaming

- Lucid dreaming is the experience of dreaming while being aware of it and being able to direct the dream activities.

- Lucid dreaming occurs in about 20% of people, and in a small percentage of those people, they lucid dream almost every night.

- Sigmund Freud talked about symbolic representations in dreams, although much of this has been debunked.

- To maximize the dream experience for the sake of learning and unlearning, it is important to look at the physiology of sleep.

- Sleep is broken up into 90-minute cycles of shallow sleep and slow-wave sleep (stage 1, 2, etc.) and REM sleep.

- Early in the night, there is more slow-wave sleep and less REM sleep.

- As the night progresses, more of the 90-minute cycle is comprised of REM sleep and less of slow-wave sleep.

- We can leverage our daytime activities to access more slow-wave sleep or REM sleep, depending on our needs.

- Lucid dreaming and drug-induced hallucinations have similarities and differences to dream states.

- Slow-wave sleep is characterized by a particular pattern of brain activity with sweeping waves of activity across the brainstem, thalamus, and cortex.

- Neuromodulators associated with slow-wave sleep include acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.

- Acetylcholine production plummets during slow-wave sleep, while norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine are active.

- Slow-wave sleep is associated with a distortion of space and time, a sensation of bliss or wellbeing, and little movement.

- Slow-wave sleep is important for motor learning and detailed learning

- Motor learning is generally occurring in slow-wave sleep

- Slow-wave sleep is primarily in the early part of the night

- Learning of motor skills and detailed information is happening primarily during slow-wave sleep in the early part of the night

- Norepinephrine and serotonin are released during slow-wave sleep

- Athletes and people concerned about performance should be aware of the importance of slow-wave sleep

- It is always better to get a full night's sleep (6 hours) than less.

- Performance will not necessarily plummet if you don't get a full night's sleep.

- Motor learning and recovery from exercise happens early in the night.

- REM sleep occurs throughout the night, but more of it is present in the morning.

- REM sleep was discovered in the 1950s when researchers observed eye movements under eyelids

- Eye movements during REM sleep are erratic and can be observed by pulling back eyelids

- REM sleep is characterized by the absence of serotonin and norepinephrine

- It is also characterized by atonia, or paralysis

- This has implications for dreaming and learning during REM sleep

- REM sleep is a stage of sleep where our eyes are moving but the rest of our body is paralyzed and we are hallucinating

- Adrenaline (epinephrine) is not released during REM sleep, which is important for adjusting our emotional relationship to challenging things that happened to us while we were awake

- Dreams during REM sleep can involve replays of things that did occur, as well as elaborate contortions of things that didn't occur, and can include social anxiety, being late to an exam, or being naked in public

- Nightmares can occur during REM sleep and can carry a lot of emotion, sometimes leading to waking up in a panic

- Nightmares are likely to occur during slow-wave sleep

- Drugs can give people scary or eerie dreams

- Common dream is feeling of paralysis and being chased

- Intense, fearful memories are unlikely to occur in REM sleep

- Some people experience waking up feeling very stressed

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

that I happen to be thinking about or dreaming about in the moments before. And that's an interesting case of an invasion of the dream state into the waking state, and the moment you wake up, epinephrine is available. So the research on this isn't fully crystallized,

- Nightmares are likely to occur during slow-wave sleep

- Thoughts and ideas from REM sleep can invade the waking state

- People may experience waking up and being paralyzed, which can be terrifying

- This paralysis can also be accompanied by hallucinations

- Alien abduction experiences have core characteristics that map closely to this phenomenon

- Slow-wave sleep early in the night is important for motor learning and detail learning.

- REM sleep has a dream component with no epinephrine, resulting in vivid dreams with no anxiety.

- Learning in REM sleep is not motor events, but rather unlearning of emotional events.

- Not getting enough REM sleep can lead to a variety of issues.

- Easily falls asleep but wakes up around 3-4am

- Uses a Non-Sleep Deep Rest Protocol to relax body and brain and fall back asleep

- Sleeps until 7am and gets a lot of REM sleep

- Lack of REM sleep can make people emotionally irritable

- REM sleep is important for emotional regulation and forming relationships with rules and algorithms.

- During REM sleep, spatial information from the day is replayed, allowing us to remember important information and forget unimportant information.

- Meaning is formed by piecing together experiences from the day.

- We have an agreed upon association with computers and information and memory, but not with pens.

- REM sleep is important for solidifying relationships and discarding irrelevant meanings.

- Sleep deprivation can lead to odd associations and hallucinations.

- Over-emotionality or catastrophizing can occur if we link the web of our experience.

- It is important to have narrow channels between individual things in order to have healthy emotional and cognitive functioning.

- REM sleep has the capacity to eliminate the meanings that don't matter.

- REM sleep is similar to clinical practices designed to eliminate emotionality and help people move through trauma.

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

are a death in the family or of a close loved one, something terrible that happened to you or somebody else, or an entire childhood or some event that in your mind and body is felt as and experienced as bad, terrible, or concerning. Many of you perhaps have heard of trauma treatment such as EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, or ketamine treatment for trauma, something that recently became legal and is in fairly widespread clinical use. Interestingly enough, EMDR and ketamine at kind of a core level bear very similar features to REM sleep. So let's talk about EMDR first. EMDR, eye movement desensitization reprocessing, is something that was developed by a psychologist, Francine Shapiro.

- A woman was walking in the forest behind Stanford and noticed that her emotional load was lessened

- She developed a practice of having her clients and patients move their eyes from side to side while recounting a traumatic event

- This practice is now approved by the American Psychological Association for the treatment of trauma

- The decision to use lateralized eye movements was made for practical reasons, such as confidentiality and weather

- The eye movements look silly but involve sitting in a chair and moving one's eyes from side to side

- EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) is a clinical tool used to help people dissociate the emotional experience of particular traumas.

- Eye movements of the sort used in EMDR have been shown to suppress the activity of the amygdala, which is involved in threat detection, stress, anxiety, and fear.

- EMDR is most successful for single event or very specific kinds of trauma, such as car crashes, and should be done in a clinical setting with a certified practitioner.

- Ketamine is a new chemical treatment that bears a lot of resemblance to the sorts of things that happen in REM sleep.

- Ketamine and PCP are dissociative anesthetics that disrupt the activity of the NMDA receptor in the brain.

- NMDA receptor is gated by intense experience and can trigger a cellular process called long-term potentiation.

- Long-term potentiation translates to a change in connectivity so that later, intense events are not needed for the neuron to become active again.

- Neurons become active and create a connection between an experience and an emotion

- Ketamine is used to prevent this connection from forming, and is used in emergency rooms to prevent intense emotions from being attached to traumatic experiences

- EMDR and REM sleep are also used to suppress the amygdala and remove emotionality from experiences

- All of these interventions are designed to act like therapy and remove emotion from experiences

- Slow-wave sleep is important for motor learning and detailed learning

- REM sleep is important for attaching emotions to experiences and unlearning emotional responses

- Mastering sleep is important for managing disruptive events

- Sleep disturbances correlate with emotional and psychological disturbances

- Menopause can have emotional effects on the brain

- Menopause is related to disruptions in temperature regulation and sleep regulation, which can impact emotionality.

- Sleep deprivation can affect energy, immune function, and self-induced therapy.

- EMDR and ketamine therapies are in-clinic therapies, while REM sleep is self-induced.

- It is important to know how to get and ensure the appropriate amount of REM sleep and slow-wave sleep.

- Devices such as the Oura Ring and Whoop band can be used to measure the quality and depth of sleep.

- Feeling rested and learning can be used to gauge sleep.

- A study by Emily Hoagland found that regularity of sleep is more important than total duration.

- Variations in total sleep time can affect learning.

- Limiting the variation in the amount of sleep is more important than just getting more sleep overall.

- Consistently getting the same amount of sleep is better than just getting more sleep.

- For every hour variation in sleep, there is a 17% reduction in performance on exams.

- Strive for a regular amount of sleep.

- Avoid drinking a lot of fluid right before going to sleep.

- Having a full bladder can disrupt sleep and cause bedwetting in children.

- Drinking a lot of water before bed can help with dream recall.

- Neurotransmitters shift during REM sleep, leading to less serotonin.

- Supplements can be taken to improve sleep.

- Taking tryptophan or 5-HTP can lead to deep sleep, but can also disrupt the timing of REM and slow-wave sleep.

- Low levels of serotonin are associated with slow-wave sleep.

- There are ways to increase slow-wave sleep, such as taking supplements.

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

apparently without any disruption to the other components of sleep and learning, is to engage in resistance exercise. It's pretty clear that resistance exercise triggers a number of metabolic and endocrine pathways that lend themselves to release of growth hormone, which happens early in the night. And resistance exercise, therefore, can induce a greater percentage of slow-wave sleep. It doesn't have to be done very close to going to bedtime. In fact, for some people, the exercise can be disruptive for reasons I've talked about in previous episodes. But resistance exercise, unlike aerobic exercise, does seem to increase the amount of slow-wave sleep, which, as we know, is involved in motor learning and the acquisition of fine, detailed information, not general rules or the emotional components of experiences. For those of you that are interested in lucid dreaming

- Set a cue before going to sleep, such as writing down a statement or drawing a picture of something you'd like to experience in a dream

- Lucid dreaming does not have to involve altering features of the dream, but can simply be the awareness that you are dreaming

- Find the right amount of sleep for you and try to get it consistently night to night

- Wake up at the end of an ultradian cycle (6 hours) rather than in the middle (7 hours)

- Alcohol and marijuana can induce pseudo sleep-like states

- Consumption of alcohol and THC can disrupt the pattern, depth, and sequencing of sleep

- Arginine may increase the amount of slow-wave sleep

- Keeping a sleep or dream journal can be useful for exploring dreams

- Keeping a dream journal can help people recall their dreams

- Dreams can be associated with either REM or slow-wave sleep

- Theory of mind is a concept that can help distinguish between REM and slow-wave sleep dreams

- Writing down dreams can help people learn more about their dreams

- Dreams can sometimes be recalled in the mid-morning or afternoon

- Theory of Mind was introduced by Simon Baron-Cohen, brother of comedian Sasha Baron-Cohen

- Theory of Mind tests are done on children to assess autism

- Theory of Mind is associated with emotional learning and social interactions

- Theory of Mind is often present in REM-associated dreams

- Dreams in REM sleep are associated with emotional unlearning of life events

- Slow wave sleep is important for motor learning and details, while REM sleep is associated with intense experiences and emotion uncoupling.

- Consistency of sleep is better than getting different amounts of sleep each night.

- Tools for improving sleep quality include morning and evening light, blue blockers, supplements, and measuring sleep duration and quality.

- Hot and cold showers can have certain benefits.

- We all experience lack of sleep from time to time and should not catastrophize it.

- Aim to get a consistent amount of sleep and use non-sleep deep rest protocols to help relax.

- There are many tools available to help with sleep, most of which are free.

- Apologies for any snoring from Costello, the 10-year-old bulldog mastiff.

This chapter is already very short - skipping summarization:

The lifespan on those animals is about 10 years. So I'm not trying to make you feel guilty, but after he's gone, there won't be any snoring, although I'll probably get a different dog. So sort of a, what would the kids say? Sorry, not sorry. Sorry, not sorry about the snoring. And I'm sorry if it's disruptive genuinely, but he's here for the haul. So that's what that's about. As we close out this segment on sleep,

of the nervous system in biology and trying to understand the mechanisms that make us who we are and how we function in sleep and in wakefulness. It's really an incredible landscape to consider. And I hope that you're getting a lot out of the information. As always, thank you for your interest in science. And I'll see you next time.
